# Chapter 3

“Hey kid, you want to buy something?”

I was currently standing in front of a toady looking street vendor selling meat skewers. I haven’t had grilled meat in a while so following the smell I arrived at this place. 

“Go ask your parents if you’ve got no money”

Three coppers for a skewer. That’s nearly half of what I had. I didn’t really like to use money on things like food, but maybe an exception could be made this time. The smell was calling me to be eaten. Opening the coin pouch my mother had gifted me, I was about to take my one silver turned ten copper coins out. 

“Do you want me to buy you one sweetie?” Mom had finally arrived and with her considerably fatter pouch. 

“Can I get one?”

Taking my first bite, the taste surprised me. It tasted amazing, a bit gamey maybe but it only added onto its charm. 

“Is this meat from the four-eyed deer monster?”

“Oh you know about them monsters, kid? You should probably learn monsters aren’t edible”

“They were supposedly poisoned by the goddess to defer us from not seeking them out”, my mother explained.

“Really?” I put the last cube in my mouth. “Wouldn’t it be better to hunt them for food?”

“Worry about yourself, kid. All bones and no muscle, just looking at you makes me want to feed you. Here take another one, on the house.” The toady vendor gave Victoria the side-eye. 

“You’re too kind, sir. My daughter was just bedridden you see…”

The vendor clicked his tongue and began nagging at her, regaling us about how back in his days no children would be as thin as me. I didn’t like his tone of voice. 

“It’s not my mother’s fault, I’m just a picky eater”

“Whatever, scurry off now”, the vendor shooed us away grumpily.

We walked away from the grumpy toady vendor. “Thanks, Esther.” She eyed the skewer in my hand. “I better make something good when we get home\!”. A smile definitely suited her better.

With two empty skewers in one hand, and my mother’s hand in the other, I accompanied her wherever she led me. The sight of the town was quite something. It looked just like a medieval city. Cobblestones laid on our path and carriages with horses could be seen going up and down the streets, clipping and clopping all the while. Passing other people on the street we arrived in front of a shop.  

“Why don’t you wait on the bench here?” A bench was set outside the store, shaded by a big leafy tree.

My legs ached a bit so I accepted her preposition. Sitting on the bench and watching the people was entertaining enough. There were some guards walking around with spears in their hand, patrolling the area, people who were haggling with the vendors trying to get the most for their money, but what caught my attention were the striking hair colors. Red, blue, green, a bunch of colors littered the heads of the passerbys. Speaking of, someone with red hair stood in front of me.

“What’s a young lady like you doing here? Never seen you here before”

A young lady, wasn’t that usually used when talking to nobles? Well I did wear a rather pretty dress and a fancy sunhat. Victoria had given me one of hers to protect me from the blinding sun. Anyway, who’s this kid?

“I’m not a young lady, my name is Esther. I’ve never seen you before either”

“Is that so? I’m Eric, I live in that house over there”, he pointed at the house next to the shop. “I’m 14”

Is this how you are supposed to introduce yourself?

“I live outside town, I’m 13”

“Looks like I’m older than you”, he smirked.

“Are you lost or something?”

“I’m waiting for my mom”.

“I see”, the boy took a seat beside me as if it was natural. He was a whole head higher than me.

It hadn’t even been a full minute before he said something. “This is boring, wanna go play instead?” 

“My mother said to not go with strangers”

Victoria didn’t tell me this but the point still stands, I think. *She* didn't really exude a sense of confidence.

“I’m not a stranger, I know your name and you know mine. Oh I know”, he rummaged through his bag, eventually pulling something wrapped in paper.

“My dad told me to give a gift to someone to make them your friend. Here take one”

It was hard-candy. I thought sugar was supposed to be pretty rare, how did this kid get some? Not passing up this opportunity, I unwrapped one and popped it into my mouth. The sweetness felt like it was burning my mouth. It had been a while since I had some sugar.

“There, we’re now friends”

“Is that how that works?”, I said, sneaking another piece into my mouth.

“Hey, don't take all of them\!” Tsk, he took them away.

“Don’t click your tongue at me\!”

“Who’s this Esther? A new friend?”. Mom was finished with her shopping.

“Yeah, he gave me some candy".

“Did he now? Well thank you for that”. Victoria gave him a smile.

“O-oh it was no problem. My name is Eric. I live over there”. His face nearly turned into the same color as his hair.

“Mom, can I go play with Eric for a bit?”

“Hmm”, she looked around at the guards, “just meet us by the fountain on the next bell, okay? I will go find your father in the meanwhile”

“You heard her, lets go Eric”

“Oh, sure”

I took the lead with Eric in tow while mom gave us a wave. Mom, you shouldn't smile like that to other men besides father.

“Hey where are you going, that’s the wrong way”

“Really? Where are we even going?”

“Weirdo” Eric gave me a funny look. “This way. All the kids play over there.”

Snaking around some alleys and streets, we arrived into a clearing, where a group of kids were chatting and running around.

“Hey guys\! A brought another one to play with”

“Eric\!” a girl in shorts came running up to us. “I told you to stop bringing over random kids\!”, she said grumpily.

“She’s not some random kid, I befriended her with some candy, isn’t that fine? She looked pretty bored so I took her along.” Rubbing his nose, it looked like he thought he did something heroic. I wasn’t actually bored.

“Ugh, well what’s done is done. I’m Karrie by the way”. 

Tilting my head up to move my sunhat from blocking my view, nothing could have prepared me for the view as the girl greeted me.

“What? What are you doing here?” That’s what I want to ask you.

“You know her?”

“She’s my neighbor. Did you get sick again? Haven’t seen you around lately”

Chestnut-brown hair done in a short bob, a pair of brown eyes and above them, two thin eyebrows framing her face. A vivid image of her laying in a casket filled my head. There was no mistaking it, the name was different but this was definitely *her*. 

“Hello? You home?”, a hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth.

“Oh, sorry. Nice to meet you, I’m Esther. I live outside of town”. 

“What kind of greeting is that supposed to be? And I already know who you are.” Tilting her head to the side. Her eyebrows seemed to question me.

“Is that so? Sorry, I lost my memories a few days ago. I don’t really remember anyone”

“Are you joking? How’s that possible”

“I don’t know, the priest examining me didn’t know much either”

“You called a priest? Must have been serious then…” 

“Whoah, that's so cool\!” Jumping into the conversation was a cheerful looking Eric.

“So you don’t remember anything?”, I nodded

“What about your parents, did you remember them?”

“Hey\! What are you saying\!”. Seeing her slap Eric on the back resurfaced some old memories. 

“Oh, when I woke up, I just saw this pretty lady looking at me” 

“Yeah that’s right, she’s really pretty\!”. Eric said, rubbing his back. Tsk.

“Hey, stop clicking your tongue at me\!”

“Well? And then what happened?”

“Hey quit it, look how sad she is getting\!”

Did I? Well this works. I had something I wanted to investigate.

“I don’t really want to talk about it, can’t we play something instead?” 

“Oh right, you said something so shocking I forgot. Any ideas?” 

Shaking her head, Karrie said. “Well, there’s only three of us for now-”

“Wow, you gonna ditch the others?”

“They only do tiring stuff, I don’t want to get all sweaty in this weather. You know anything interesting to do, Esther?”

“I don’t remember”

“Wow… I bet you use that often”, Eric said incredulously. Karrie glanced at me and couldn’t help but agree.

Ridiculous as it sounds, it was the truth, or more correctly, I didn’t know any games. Having never had the chance to play with others, remembering games or fun things to do was just wasted energy I could instead use to survive. Well, there was one game I was subjected to against my will.  

“How about truth or dare?”, I spat out.

“You serious?” They said in tandem.

“Sorry, that was a joke…”
