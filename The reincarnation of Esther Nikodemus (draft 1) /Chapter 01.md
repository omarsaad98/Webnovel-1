# Chapter 1

Standing there in front of the statue, I couldn’t help but glare at it. It was a gold-plated statue of a buddha. A master craftsman had probably sculpted it, declaring it his life’s work, getting praised by all the monks visiting. But all I felt as it stood there, towering over me, was irritation. Its expression seemed to be mocking me. A perfectly symmetrical smug smile. 

I had been shot. Pressing down on the wound in my abdomen did little to stop the warm trail of blood sliding down my legs, staining the wooden floorboards in the process. The smell of incense invaded my nose, the same way the flashing red and blue lights invaded through the shuttered windows, painting away the darkness. 

The sirens were still blaring and occasional shouts could be heard surrounding this secluded temple. A familiar voice echoed through the night through the help of a megaphone.

“You are surrounded\! Come out with your hands up\!” 

It was the detective that has been chasing me for the past few weeks. 

I had a nagging feeling of being watched and got my suspicions confirmed when he showed up at the temple. He had asked me a bunch of questions but not once did he write down my answers. He just stared at me. I couldn’t help but stare back at his peculiar scar over his left eye.

In this bustling concrete jungle of a city, stood a lonesome temple on the outskirts of top of a hill. Instead of skyscrapers surrounding it, trees and plants did instead. Having nowhere else to go, I eventually found myself standing before this very place. A monk sweeping the grounds had greeted me, introduced himself and then broke out into a long winded lesson, regaling the history of the temple. 

Did I ask for this service? No. Did I ask him to stop? No, of course not. This happened more often than I would admit, someone finding me and blathering on and on about this or that. He looked increasingly more cheerful the more he talked, hitting all the bullet points. I must have been the only one that listened to his whole presentation.

Having learnt all the ins and outs of the temple, the monk invited me to have a meal as a reward. Having nothing but the shirt on my back, I accepted. Stuffing my face with food for the first time in a while, my body just wanted to lay down and sleep. Noticing this, the monk offered me a room to use, perhaps noticing my predicament. I, a young girl, had just wandered into a temple with nothing.

The room was intended for monks-in-training but no one had shed their modern life in recent years. The room had a mattress and that was it. It was bare. It was like looking into a mirror. I accepted the room.

The sounds of heavy footsteps came closer and closer and the silhouettes obstructed the windows. Glancing down at my blood-stained knife, I debated which way to die was less painful. Stabbing myself in the neck, or getting shot by those standing over there.

The monks at the temple were a little surprised when they saw that a new face had popped up overnight. They began chatting with me immediately, debating to each other about this or that while I stood there, watching. When I had opened my mouth and told them that I wasn’t a new monk in training, I expected them to be a little disappointed. They just smiled gently at me instead.

There were two things stopping me from becoming a real monk-in-training. One, I couldn’t follow the base five precepts. I had already committed one of them. The other reason had something to do with this room, the room with the big statue.

This was my first time in this room. I had tried to enter before but each time, as if some invisible barrier had formed, I couldn’t cross the boundary of the doorway. The golden statue acted like some talisman, protecting itself from me. But strangely enough, I had no problems entering today, my bloody footprints painting a path across the wide floor.

“Death is not the end, nor is life the start. We will all suffer while under the effect of the wheel of reincarnation.” A monk said to me one day. I didn’t really want to die but the thought of reincarnating again seemed to fill me with hope. Maybe I will be a cat in my next life? Laying about and sleeping whenever, or I could be a bird? Spreading out my wings and gliding through the open air. 

My consciousness flickered in and out as I laid there in front of the statue. In the end, I couldn’t choose how I died. I just bled out with the glowing statue smiling down at me.

\*\*\*

“Detective, is this really her? The one making waves in the headlines lately?”

The officer couldn’t help but ask after seeing the dead body of the girl. He had a daughter about her age. All she did was chat with her friends on the phone and staying up all night.  

“Don’t let her appearance fool you, we already have three confirmed bodies”

“Really? You really can’t judge a book by its cover. How did a girl like her turn into a ruthless killer?” The officer took a picture. “She must have been possessed or something, look at this place. The statues give me the creeps, I tell you” He rubbed his arms.

“Enough chatting, wrap it up and give me that report. The media and higher ups have been on my ass ever since that incident.”

“What a shame, he was about to retire and all…”

“He had a promotion lined up and all…” The detective left to light a smoke.

“Good riddance.” Draping a sheet of cloth over the girl, the officer began with his report.

\*\*\*  
My hands lit up and I injected the girl with my divine mana. It didn’t work.

“Father\!” The mother looked distraught, “My daughter, she will wake up won’t she? She must be just sleeping, right?”

Having looked over this girl from late morning to late night, I could only come to one conclusion. Her daughter won’t be able to open her eyes again.

“I’m sorry… it’s not working…” Divine magic was supposed to heal all except for a few cases. Cases where the patient was going to die no matter what. I had expended all of mana.

“She doesn't have long…” 

It was never easy telling a parent about the fate of their child. The woman wailed as she held unto her dying daughter.

“You should start the ritual”. The goddess had given us magic and rituals to help us live. The ritual would ensure a safe passage for a person’s soul on its destination to the pearly gates.

“No\!” She cried. “I won’t do it\! She’s not dead\! My baby, open your eyes please\!”

She grabbed my garment, pleading. “You can use healing magic can't you? Why isn’t it doing anything?\!”

I stayed silent.

Even if divine magic couldn’t turn a terminal ill person into a healthy person, it should still have had some effect. But each time I tried to inject her with mana, it simply bounced off. She must already be dead.

“Oh my baby, please open your eyes. What am I supposed to do without you\!”

The plethora of plants and medicines sprawled across the room, seemed to tell about the girl’s long struggle against her body. Hearing what the mother said, I couldn’t imagine how it must have been living with an unknown incurable disease. Being bedridden whenever she walked too far, getting life endangering fevers for no reason, and not being able to retain her food. What a pitiful life this child has lived.

At least she seemed to be at peace laying there on the bed. A sharp contrast to the haggard looking mother, despair evident on her face. Her golden blonde hair laid to her sides. Her mother had combed it, holding onto whatever hope she had for her daughter. Probably expecting her to wake up any moment now. Apart from her hair, she also inherited the color of her eyes. The pair of brilliantly blue eyes reflected the light from the magic-powered lamp and stared at her mother. They could almost be mistaken for being sisters. Hmm? Staring?

“What am I to tell your father\!” Her tears dropped onto the girl's cheek, leaving a trail as it plopped onto the pillow.

“What…”

Flinching from the unexpected sound, her tears stopped in their tracks. 

What? How is this possible?

“Oh my goddess\!” She let out a yell full of joy. “My baby\!”

“A miracle… This must be a miracle…” I have just witnessed a real miracle. I must document this.

I rummaged through my bags to find something to write on, and while the mother hugged her child shedding tears of joy, the words from the little girl stopped us both from moving.

“Who are you?” A hoarse voice called out.

\*\*\*

The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was a beautiful crying woman. An angel? That can’t be. I can’t be in heaven. The woman seemed to be shocked about something. Her expression mirrored the expression of the man next to her, who wore some really gaudy white clothes reminiscent of the priests that had visited the temple. 

Didn’t I die? I tried to ask them but my voice failed to make a sound. Glancing downwards the view shocked me. This wasn’t my body. As I thought of moving my hand, a small childlike hand moved accordingly instead. An unnatural gold-colored hair flowed by the sides of my view and my chest had gotten a bit smaller… 

This must be a dream, but the aches in my body soon banished that thought. Everything hurt as I laid there in the bed. The pain was even worse than being shot.

Using all the strength I could muster, I focused my attention on the woman. “Who are you?” Even my voice was different. 

I stared absentmindedly at the bowl of porridge in my hands. The warmth from it seeped through my hands, heating up my body a little. Its grayish color didn’t exactly whet my appetite but as the flying spoon flew toward my mouth I had to accept it nonetheless. 

*One shouldn’t judge a book by its cover,* I remembered hearing someone say. A subtle sweetness enveloped my tongue as the porridge spread through my mouth and down my throat, warming it up.

She looked at me with crescent moon shaped eyes. “How is it?” 

“It’s good” My childlike voice rang out. “What is it?” 

“I’m glad”, she said with a big smile, “it’s oat porridge, I used to make it whenever you would get sick”. I accepted another spoonful from her.

This woman was supposedly my mother. A pretty woman with golden hair the same as mine and brilliant blue eyes reminiscent of a cloudless blue sky. Her youthful stature would make one wonder if she was a actual mother, her age doesn’t show at all.

According to this woman, Victoria, my name was Esther, 13 years old. I had been struggling with illnesses my whole life but it was especially bad this time, even putting me on the edge of death. The priest had said that it was a miracle as someone not accepting healing magic was a sure sign of death. Although he had no answers as to why I didn’t have any memories.

Healing magic. Magic. I don’t really know what to expect anymore. But I knew for a fact by instinct, that the one that was supposed to be in this body, Esther, was dead. I didn’t feel the need to tell him that. Victoria looked gleefully at the now empty bowl of porridge. 

A day had passed since I’ve taken over Esther’s body. My body still ached all over but speaking had become less of a strain, so I passed the time by asking a bunch of questions to Victoria.

This country was called the Guillain Empire and it was currently year 563 of the imperial calendar. We lived in some town ruled by some baron whose name I couldn’t remember. This doesn’t sound like the earth I knew.

“A planet? Is it some kind of plant?” She was sitting on a chair by my bedside. 

“It’s not a plant, I think, I just remembered the word”

Her eyes were filled with hope. “Really? Do you remember anything else?”

“No, sorry…” 

“Oh, it’s nothing to be sorry about sweetie, lets just take it slow”

She put her hand onto my head and began patting me. It felt oddly comforting. 

“M-mom?” The word got stuck in my throat. “Can I ask another question?”

“Of course\!” She pumped her fists, cheering me on.

“Do I have a dad?”

“Oh…” She looked like a wilted flower.

“He’s on a monster expedition”

“Monsters? They sound dangerous”

“They can be…” She looked out the window. “But don’t you worry a bit my little pumpkin, your father is stronger than he looks\! Why do you think I married him?”  
She began singing his praises. I could tell from the way she spoke about her husband that they were a happy couple.

I searched my memories for some involving my father but quickly stopped. It was a stupid idea. 

“Do you think he will be glad to see me?”

“Why do you say that?” Her concerned face came a bit closer as she held my hands.

“I don’t remember him at all.” Clenching my hands in her own, she pulled me into a hug. 

“It doesn’t matter my baby, we would still love you all the same. There is always time for new memories, and who knows? Maybe your memories will come back tomorrow?”

I could feel the warmth in her words as she hugged me, warming up my own body. A twinge of guilt took its place in my heart, where her body warmth had seeped into. I didn’t want to let go of this warmth.
