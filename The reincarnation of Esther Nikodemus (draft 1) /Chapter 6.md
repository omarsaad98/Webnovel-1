# Chapter 6

I felt like this situation had happened before. 

“It’s not a joke.”

“Thanks for cheering me up, Esther.” She took a deep breath and pointed her gaze at me. 

“The truth is, I always wanted to be friends with you, but you were a bit hard to talk to…”, she bowed her head. “I want to apologize”.

Being on the receiving end of an apology felt weird, I was always the one who apologized. Standing there watching the top of her hair, no words came to mind. 

“This is so embarrassing\!” Karrie couldn’t take it anymore, her cheeks were red like beets. “Just say whether you accept it or not\!”  

“Oh sorry, I accept your apology.”

“No\! Now it just sounds like I forced you”, Karrie seemed to struggle with something as she hid her face behind her hands.

“It’s fine Karrie, I want to be friends with you too”

“Really?”, she peeked between her fingers. “Even when I said those things about you?”

“Don’t worry about it, you didn’t talk about me”

“Yeah right…”

“More importantly”, something had nagged at me for a while now, “where does Finn live?”

Karrie looked a bit shocked. “Why? Are you joining his group?” 

“No way, it’s so that I can stay away from him. He looks stupid.”

“You’re right about that”, a chuckle slipped out.

Throwing out a bunch of insults at Finn, Karrie told me what his address was.

“I see,” I gave her the biggest smile I could, “Thanks”.

I was currently standing in the industrial district where a cacophony of noises could be heard. Black smoke was blooming atop the chimneys of the blacksmiths and the clinking of the armored people could be heard as they went around looking for new gear. 

“This ain’t no place for a younging like you to go play around”. A sooty old man said to me. “Where are you parents, kid”.

The knives on display looked really well made. 

“Did you make all the knives yourself?”

The man crossed his arms. “Knives? Never have I ever- these are *daggers*”

I tilted my head. “What’s the difference?” 

Looking exasperated, he went around the stall to face me. I had to crane my neck to look at him. 

“The difference, young lady, is that daggers are used for killing things”. Picking up one of the *daggers,* he took a few stabs at the air.

“I see”

“Understood? Now go along, no customers of mine will buy anything with a dainty girl like you standing around-”

“How much for this one?” I pointed to a simple looking dagger.

He scrunched his face. “Didn’t you hear me? These are for killing things”. He gave me a new glance, looking me up and down.

“Five silvers”

I shook my coin pouch hanging to my side. “Do you have anything for one silver?”

“Check that box over there, pick whatever”

The box was piled up with 

The box was piled in the dozens with shabby looking products. “Made ‘em in my apprentice days.”

“Must be really old then.”

“I see you got humour in you, kid”

Picking the most decent dagger out of the lot, I gripped the handle and gave it a few swings. 

I could hear the old man let out an impressed \_\_\_.

The dagger was made out of a single piece of metal looking like a big toothpick. The handle was wrapped in some type of leather, counterbalancing the whole thing nicely. This would do.

“You seem to really like it.” He looked happy. “Take it, just pay me back by spreading my name”. Engraved on the blade were two letters T and K. 

The merchants in this town seemed to like to give me free things. I gave him my thanks and put the dagger into my bag. Karrie was waiting for me at the end of the street. 

Our family had met up with hers and suggested having a bite together in town. While the adults talked about adult things, after eating at the restaurant, Karrie and I scurried off to look at things.

“I don’t get why you wanted to look around here, Esther. It stinks”

She turned to her left. “And why are you here?”

Eric had joined up with us. “You guys looked to do something fun\!”

“All’s fun with you isn't it?” She let out a sigh.

“Are you done with this place, Esther?”

I nodded.

“Nice\! Let’s go check out that huge crowd over there\! Eric said excitedly. 

He told us that the Executioner had struck again.

While dragging us with he told us about the killer that had been wrecking havoc in the town the last few weeks. And whenever there was a gathering of guards, it meant a new body had popped up.

The guards made a line of no entry, blocking the crowd from the thing they were surrounding. There was a man kneeling on the ground, his job seemed to be a farmer judging by his clothes. The thing he cradled in his arms stared at me; a pair of lifeless eyes. Where his head should have been was instead a flower. A white lily stained with blood. The man had been decapitated.

“How horrible…” A woman from the crowd gasped.

“Tsk, of course it's another one of us”, another man spat.

“Goddess, please protect us”, an old woman broke out into prayer.

The blood had pooled on the rough cobblestones underneath, painting a picturesque scene. It looked almost religious. 

Covering my face in my hands, I could feel the corners of my face twitch.

“Eric, I’m about to puke… Why did you bring us here?” Karrie had lost all color on her face.

“I thought it would be cool…” Eric bit his lips. His usual cheerful self nowhere to be seen. 

“You okay Esther?” Karrie patted my back as I stood there hiding my face. 

*Esther, you shouldn’t smile so brightly in this situation.* I know, but what am I supposed to do? I haven’t felt like this in a while. *Even so, you have to be mindful. What if your new friends were to see you smiling?* They would find it creepy. *Yes, so wipe that grin off your face right now.* Doing as I was told, crouched down trying to find the right expression. 

“Let’s get out of here, she doesn’t look well.” Karrie, you are so sweet.

“Hello kids, you look like you’ve seen a ghost or something\!”, Karrie’s father guffawed. 

“Uh, yeah, ha ha.” Eric replied.

Sitting around the table were our parents chatting away. 

“What happened?” Victoria asked us. 

Seeing that Karrie and Eric didn’t know what to say, I spoke up. “Do ghosts really exist?”

“‘Course they do? Why, I saw one myself this one time\!” He was loud.

“There he goes again…” His wife let out a sigh.

“You don't look well, come here”. Victoria picked me up and put me on her lap. Karrie looked a bit envious considering what had just transpired.

“Oh, yeah?” Gale asked. “And then what did you do?”

“What did I do? Well I ran of course”

His wife let out another sigh. “I don’t understand why you are telling other people about your cowardice…”

“Nonsense\! It’s not called cowardice, it's called being smart. Think, how am I supposed to beat up a ghost?” He looked proud as he tapped his head with a finger.

“Speaking of, what happened to that job of yours?”

“Dont even mention it”, he leant back into his chair crossing his arms. “They suddenly cancelled the job saying some nonsense about how we weren’t the right fit”

“Hah, if you’re not the right fit then I wonder who is?”

Victoria fed me one of the bits of food on the table. “I’m just glad nothing dangerous happened”. The two others just stared absentmindedly in the air.

“It did sound suspicious." Karrie’s mother remarked. “I tell you, all men think they are invincible.”  

“It adds to their charm don’t you think?”, she covered her mouth as she gave out a laugh. 

“It’s a wonder how you two are still in your honeymoon phase…”, she glanced at her husband who just gave a shrug.

Karrie’s father thought for a moment. “Maybe they got scared off by the Executioner?” Hearing the moniker, Eric and Karrie jumped a little.

“What a horrid nickname, they still haven’t catched them?” Gale replied.

“Well, you know how our lord does things here”, he pointed his chin towards where the count’s manor stood. 

Clicking his tongue, Gale chugged down his cup. “They always prioritise the wrong things. What happened to noblesse oblige?”

“That nobles had the duty to protect the peoples? Ha, you really believe in that nonsense?”

The four adults continued to chat with each other and then it was time to head home. Eric promised to do something actually fun next time and apologized to us. Karrie gave him a smack on his back, telling him it was fine. I didn’t mind, I had better things to think about. 

Tonight. Tonight? *Tonight.*
