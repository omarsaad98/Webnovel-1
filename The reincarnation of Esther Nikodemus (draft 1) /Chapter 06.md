# Chapter 6

I felt like this situation had happened before. 

“It’s not a joke.”

“Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Esther.” She took a deep breath and pointed her gaze at me. 

“But I did really say those things about you…” Her face scrunched up. 

“The truth is, I always wanted to be friends with you, but you were so hard to talk to…” She bowed her head. “I want to apologize\!”

Being on the receiving end of an apology felt weird. I was always the one who apologized. Standing there watching the top of her head, my mind turned still. 

“Ugh, this is so embarrassing\!” Karrie couldn’t take it anymore, her cheeks were red like beets. “Just say whether you accept it or not\!”  

“Oh. Sorry, I accept your apology.” Good save, Karrie.

“No\! Now it just sounds like I forced you\!” Karrie seemed to struggle with something as she hid her face behind her hands.

“It’s fine Karrie” I stared at her face. “I want to be friends with you too”

“Really?” She peeked between her fingers. “Even when I said those things about you?”

“Don’t worry about it, you didn’t talk about me”

“Yeah right…”

“More importantly”, something had scratched at me for a while now, “where does Finn live?”

Karrie opened her eyes wide, she looked betrayed. “Why? Are you going to throw me away?” 

“What are you talking about, I just don’t want to run into him. I don’t want his stupidity spreading”

“Oh…” A nervous chuckle slipped out. “You scared me for a second there\!”

Throwing out a bunch of insults at Finn, Karrie told me what his address was.

“I see,” I gave her the biggest smile I could, “Thanks”.

\*\*\*

I was currently standing in the industrial district where a cacophony of noises could be heard. Black smoke was blooming atop the chimneys of the blacksmiths and the clinking of the armored people could be heard as they went around looking for new gear. 

“This ain’t no place for a younging like you to go play around”. A sooty old man said to me. “Where are you parents, kid”.

The street even had magic-powered street lamps. What a weird juxtaposition of the modern-looking streetlamps and the sweaty men hammering away on their anvils.

“Did you make all the knives yourself?” The knives on display looked really well made. 

The man crossed his arms. “Knives? Never have I ever- these are *daggers*”

I tilted my head. “What’s the difference?” 

Looking exasperated, he staggered around the stall to face me. I had to crane my neck to look at him. 

“The difference, young lady, is that daggers are used for killing things”. Picking up one of the *daggers,* he took a few stabs at the air.

“I see”

“Understood? Now go along, you’re scaring off the other customers-”

“How much for this one?” I pointed to a simple looking dagger.

He scrunched his face. “Didn’t you hear me? These are for killing things”. He gave me a new glance, looking me up and down.

“Five silvers”

I opened the bag Victoria had made for me, it looked like a pocketbook. 

“Do you have anything for one silver?”

He clicked his tongue. “Check that pile over there, rejects, the lot of them.”

The box was piled in the dozens with either bent products or half-finished projects. 

“Made ‘em in my apprentice days”

“Must be really old then.” I remarked.

“I see you got humour in you, kid”

He picked the most decent thing out for me. It was a dagger made of a single piece of metal, it looked like a big toothpick. 

Holding it in my hand I gave it a few swings and stabs. The old man let out an impressed whistle upon seeing my movements. It was well made, this would do.

“You seem to really like it.” He seemed to be enjoying himself.

I tried giving him my silver coin but he stopped me with the palm of his hand. 

“Take it, just pay me back by spreading my name”. He pointed to the letters engraved on the blade, T and K. 

The merchants in this town seemed to like to give me free things. Putting the dagger in my pocketbook, I gave him a curtsy I learnt from Victoria and went on my merry way. Karrie was waiting for me at the end of the street. 

Our family had met up with hers and suggested having a bite together in town. While the adults talked about adult things, after eating at the restaurant, Karrie and I scurried off to look at things.

“I don’t get why you wanted to look around here, Esther. It stinks” The smoke snakes rustled above the roofs.

She turned to her left. “And why are you here?”

Eric had joined up with us. “You guys looked to do something fun\!”

“All’s fun with you isn't it?” She let out a sigh.

“Are you done with this place, Esther?”

I nodded.

“Nice\! Let’s go check out that huge crowd over there\! Eric said excitedly. 

He told us that the Executioner had struck again.

While dragging us with he told us about the killer that had been wrecking havoc in the town the last few weeks. And whenever there was a gathering of guards, it meant a new body had popped up. Finn’s father was directing the other guards.

The guards made a line of no entry, blocking the crowd from the thing they were surrounding. There was a man kneeling on the ground, he seemed to be a farmer judging by his clothes. The thing he cradled in his arms stared at me; a pair of lifeless eyes. Where his head should have been was instead a flower. A white lily stained with blood. The man had been decapitated.

“How horrible…” A woman from the crowd gasped.

“Tsk, of course it's another one of us.” Another working man spat.

“Goddess, please protect us from this demon\!” An old woman broke out into prayer.

The blood had pooled on the rough cobblestones underneath, painting a picturesque scene. It looked almost religious. 

Covering my face in my hands, I could feel the corners of my face twitch.

“Eric, I’m about to puke… Why did you bring us here?” Karrie had lost all color on her face.

“I thought it would be cool…” Eric bit his lips. His usual cheerful self nowhere to be seen. 

“You okay Esther?” Karrie patted my back as I stood there hiding my face. 

Sorry Ann, I don’t want to see your face right now. And I don’t want you to see mine either. My teeth were showing. I squatted down.

“You kids over there\!” The green haired man yelled out to us.

“What are you doing here?” He marched towards us, “Oh is that you Karrie?” His serious face disappeared, a big smile had replaced it. 

“Oh hello sir…” 

“What’s with that greeting? You’re practically my daughter\!” He bellowed.

“Are you playing nice with my son?”

“Yeah, Finn’s really funny\!” Eric said.

Peeking from my spot, I noticed his face twitch a little.

“Is that so?” He beamed. “He’s funny is it?”

“Is your friend over there okay?”

“Oh she’s just feeling unwell, we should head back” I could hear the awkwardness in Karrie’s voice. 

“You kids do that, this isn’t a pretty sight”. His face turned serious again, but I could detect something in his expression, something cheerful.

“Let’s get out of here, Eric. Esther doesn’t look that good” 

Karrie, you’re such a sweet girl.

\*\*\*

“Hello kids, you look like you’ve seen a ghost or something\!” Karrie’s father guffawed. 

“Uh, yeah, ha ha.” Eric replied.

Sitting around the table were our parents chatting away. 

“What happened?” Victoria asked us. 

Seeing that Karrie and Eric didn’t have anything to say, I spoke up. “Do ghosts really exist?”

“‘Course they do\! Why, I saw one myself this one time\!” He was loud.

His wife let out a sigh. “There he goes again…” 

“You don't look well, come sit with me”. Victoria picked me up and put me on her lap. Karrie looked a bit envious considering what had just transpired.

“Oh, yeah?” Gale asked. “And then what did you do?”

“What did I do? Well I ran of course”

His wife let out another sigh. “I don’t understand why you are telling other people about your cowardice…”

“Nonsense\! It’s not cowardice, it's called being smart. Think”, he tapped his head with a finger, “how am I supposed to beat up a ghost? I don't know how to use magic\!” He looked proud as he pointed his nose in the air.

“Speaking of, what happened to that job of yours?”

“Dont even mention it.” He leant back into his chair crossing his arms. “They suddenly cancelled it, saying some nonsense about how we weren’t the right fit”

“Hah, if you’re not the right fit then I wonder who is?”

“I know right? Although this isn’t the first time this happened lately.” Gale threw his hand in the air. “What must one do to get a decent paying job…”

Victoria fed me one of the bits of food on the table. “I’m just glad nothing dangerous happened”. The two others just stared absentmindedly in the air.

“It did sound suspicious." Karrie’s mother remarked. “I tell you, all men think they are invincible.”  

“It adds to their charm don’t you think?” She covered her mouth as she gave out a small laugh. 

“It’s a wonder how you two are still in your honeymoon phase…” She glanced at her husband. He just shrugged.

Karrie’s father thought for a moment. “Maybe they got scared off by the Executioner?” Hearing the moniker, Eric and Karrie jumped a little.

“What a horrid nickname, they still haven’t catched them?” Gale replied.

“Well, you know how our lord baron does things here” He pointed his chin towards where the baron’s manor stood. 

Clicking his tongue, Gale chugged down the rest of his cup. “They always prioritise the wrong things. What happened to noblesse oblige?”

“That nobles had the duty to protect the peoples? Ha, you really believe in that nonsense?”

The four adults continued to chat with each other until it was time to head home. Eric promised to do something actually fun next time and apologized to Karrie and I. To which Karrie gave him a smack on his back, telling him it was fine. 

I didn’t mind, I had better things to think about. 

Tonight. Tonight? *Tonight.*
