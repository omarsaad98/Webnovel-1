# Chapter 9

The steam coming from the cup of tea placed in front of me, flew gently toward the ceiling, eventually disappearing like a dream. Thrown on the dinner table was the letter Raviel had gifted my dad. The pure white piece of paper was crumpled, several creases were visible. Were you to follow those creases like a piece of origami, I would believe it would make a wonderful ball of paper. I glanced at my parents sitting at the table.

My mom clenched her cup of tea

My mom gripped her cup of tea, stroking the handle with her thumb. “Do you know why you were called back?” 

“How should I know what my father is thinking?” My dad spat out. My mom’s shoulders shrank into herself, making her silhouette smaller. My hands palmed into themselves as I averted my gaze to my cup. This scene was too familiar. My body began to prickle. 

He sighed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to say it like that”, he said as he covered my mom’s hands. “It’s just…” He paused. “I really don't know.”

“How did they even find us?” Her hands were turning white as they wrapped around the cup. “Why now?” Glistening beads began to form in the corner of her eyes. Her body began to tremble. 

My dad stood up and wrapped her into his arms. He said nothing as he stood there, letting his wife crease up his ironed shirt. Wet stains formed where my mother’s face dug into his messed up shirt. I felt my body heat flush.

I went outside.

Taking in the cool winter air, my breath formed a little cloud as I exhaled. I thought happy days would follow me after my birthday party, however the nailing pain in my fingers drove my mind back to reality. The letter was like a curse, bringing with it misfortune. I hadn’t slept well, I hadn’t eaten well, and dad had gotten later and later home. My mom always hugged me, but it didn’t feel the same. A veil of some sort had been placed above us.

I bent my damaged finger. It sent a signal to my brain making me frown. My parents had come to a consensus when I placed myself back into the house. We were to leave this town in a week.

\*\*\*

“I still can’t believe it…” Karrie’s dad said. “Who would’ve thunk you were a noble?”

We were currently loading our possessions into a horse-drawn wagon outside our house. My dad had made quick work stacking the boxes making only a few remain. 

“Well, you never asked.” He patted his friend on the shoulder as the last box, which my books were, was getting loaded in the cloth-roofed canopy. 

“As for me”, Karrie’s mom said, “I always knew something was different about you.” She looked him up and down. “An aura of sorts?”

“Hey, what's with your leering look, woman.” Her husband shot back. “Don’t you look at my friend like that\!” He went in front of my dad, shielding him from his wife.

“Get out of the way\! Don’t touch him with your filthy commoner hands\!”

The two of them had been considerably shocked when they found out my dad’s surname for the first time. Yet, like the speed of questions thrown toward my parents, they went just as fast back to acting like usual. They bantered back and forth as the finalizations were done. 

“My dear Victoria\!” She held my mom’s hands. “I can’t believe you are leaving me all alone in this town…”

“What are you saying? You still have your husband.” She smiled prettily.

Karrie’s mom clicked her tongue and feigned a faint, putting the back of her hand on her forehead. “I don’t think I can do it…” 

My mom let out a laugh. “I promise I will send you a bunch of letters.”

“You better hold onto that promise\!” She said, giving her an enormous hug. 

“I don’t think I can do that…” Karrie had watched our moms. 

“Why not? I like hugs”

She blushed. “It’s embarrassing.”

This would probably be the last time that I saw Karrie. The distance from here to our destination was considerable, even when that shortened with the help of magic teleporting gates. I didn’t even get surprised when I first heard about them, I thought to myself, surprised. 

I had gotten familiar with essentially seeing her everyday. We would chat together, take strolls together, collect insects together, and find ourselves occasionally making trouble. It reminded me of that short period of time in my past. I pressed back the tingling feeling creeping up my nose.

I gave her a hug. “Take care, Karrie.” 

“You too, Esther\!” 

Standing there surrounded by the melting snow, our smiles seemed to warm our bodies.

Their waving arms had disappeared with the horizon as I sat back down in the rocking wagon. My body was getting jostled side to side by the wooden wheels grinding through the cold-hardened dirt. I didn’t know I was prone to getting car-, wagon sick. 

I managed to eek out a question on how further we had to drive. My father simply smiled at me splayed onto my mother’s lap. We hadn’t even started, he said. I felt myself despair as my mother combed through my hair.

The empire had an extensive network of magic gates connecting various cities together, making it easy for people to move around the vast land of the empire. As one might suspect, it cost a considerable sum to use one of these gates. As a result, only higher ranked nobles or merchants with vast fortunes were the ones benefiting from them. In the letter, demanding my dads return, was an eight-sided token. This allowed us to use the magic gate for free but only once. Duke Nikodemus must have wanted his son to visit as fast as possible. Thinking about it, wouldn’t that make him my grandfather?

“Don’t get your hopes up, Esther. He isn’t the type of person to be playing house.”

“What about my grandmother?” My dad smiled. 

My mom answered my question. “She’s a wonderful woman.” She mirrored her husband's expression. “Did you know she saved my life once?” 

I couldn’t help but wonder how such contrasting reactions could come from the mention of my grandparents. I wonder how such a mismatched couple could even conceive a person like my dad. My grandmother must be a really grand woman. 

My parents chatted together as we traveled to the neighboring city where a gate was available. And finally, after a whole day of suffering on the seats of the wagon, we arrived at the entrance to the city.

“This looks good enough.” My dad opened the door to the room we had rented for the day. The magic gate required a half day's worth of time to check our cargo and clear it for transport. Not wanting to arrive earlier than required, my dad suggested resting in this city for a day. I welcomed that thought.

I threw myself on the bed. It smelled a little funny, but I couldn’t care less right now. My eyes were still spinning even when I closed my eyes. 

I threw myself onto the bed, digging my face into the pillow. It smelt of lavender. They just had to use flowers. My eyes span around behind my eyelids like ballet dancers as I tried to hold in the rising feel of my stomach.

“Oh, my poor daughter…” I felt my mothers touch as she patted my back. 

“I don’t want to ride the wagon anymore…”

My dad shattered that hope. “Sorry to say this, but we are still only halfway.”

“Mom…”

“Just rest for now, sweetie. We can go eat some delicious food\!” I heard her say cheerfully.

*I didn’t want to eat anything*, was what I had previously thought as I stood there in the bakery. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the store, not letting a single visitor escape unscathed. Displayed by the counter stood countless types of pastries, ranging from simple wheat rolls to elegantly designed cakes in all types of colors. It looked just like one of those cafes I had seen in my previous life. 

I shook my pocketbook and heard some coins clink together, ringing out like bells. My allowance for the day was a whole three silver coins. Add to that my first ever silver coin, it totaled to a considerable sum. The first silver coin I had gotten was still with me, accompanying me whenever I went out. I had originally wanted to spend it on something or the other but each time my plotting failed. The only explanation was that it was enchanted by magic. I considered it a lucky charm of some sorts.

“How much for a slice of that cake?” I pointed to something plain-looking.

“That’ll be five silvers.” The barista-looking woman answered.

I had to pick up my fallen jaw. My dad had said that five silver should be enough to buy enough interesting souvenirs and still have enough for food and snacks. Why, our room cost us only three silvers for the day.

I pointed to a bag of cookies. “What about that?”

“That’ll be two silvers.” I felt something stab into my heart.

Pointing to a stupid looking bread roll I asked. “What about-”

“That’ll be three coppers.” The woman was smiling at me.

Standing outside the bakery I bit into my bread roll. It tasted like bread. Disappointed, I sat down on a nearby bench and watched as the people and carriages passed by. It was one of my new hobbies.

The busy city road was double the width of those in our town and the amount of people busily strutting to and fro must have been four times as many. The sound of the carriage wheels sent shivers down my spine as it rolled along the muddy road.

The pure white color of snow I had gotten used to seeing the past few months was nowhere to be seen. Replacing it was the color brown. Brown roads, brown horses and brown three-coppers costing bread. Something red broke up the monotony as it approached me.

“Eshter?” The red hair called out to me.

“What are you doing here?”

I observed the boy that had left town two weeks ago. He was learning the trade of his family and went around nearby towns and cities seeking profit from his wares. He had grown considerably since the first time I saw him. His face had lost some of its boyness and his shoulders looked to be sturdier. He smirked at me.

“Did you get lost again?”

I considered throwing the half eaten piece of bread at his stupid face.
