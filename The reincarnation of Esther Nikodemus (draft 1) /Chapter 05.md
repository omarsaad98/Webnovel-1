# Chapter 5

Sitting on the prayer bench, I couldn’t help but feel a little irked as I stared at the marble statue of the Goddess. Today was the day of the Goddess, the seventh day of the week. 

I had already made out a plan for today. First, wear something comfortable, then go to town, maybe with Karrie if she wanted and then use the whole day to go find something interesting to spend my money on. My plan went into the bin when my mother woke me up and told me to get ready to go to church.

The sight of statues was starting to really annoy me. Towering over us under the stained glass window, it was draped in all kinds of colors. Did they all really need to have such a smug face? I contemplated how high I had to grow to be able to punch it in its face.

The headpriest raised his arms. “And onto us the Goddess bestowed us these five commands\!”. That sounded familiar.

He went on to explain the five rules one had to follow to not be damned: Murder, theft, adultery, lying, and intoxication.

I was taken aback. It was the same as the five precepts the monks used to tell me. 

“Do you know why intoxication, being drunk in other words, is mentioned last?” The monk had said to me once. “You are probably wondering why murder is last, right?”

“Let me tell you a story”

There once was a man living with his wife in a village. He had a good reputation as an upright man, helping whoever needed help and many envied how harmonious his family was.

One day, walking back to his home after a long day of work, he felt really thirsty. The sun had been beating down on him the whole day, making him sweat through his clothes. 

The way back home was quite a distance so he knocked on the houses he passed by to ask for some water.

Knock, knock\!

“Mister, what are you doing knocking on my door this late?” The house owner opened the door.

“Sorry about this, but I’m just feeling so thirsty\! You wouldn't happen to have some water lying about?”

“Water?” The house owner pondered. “It’s a bit late to draw up some water right now, would you like some wine instead?”

“Water or wine, I will take whatever\! I can feel my mouth turning into sand”

And so the man got a bottle of wine. 

The truth is, the man had never had a sip of alcohol before. He had seen other people drink it, and they typically took the whole thing in one gulp. Opening the cork, he drained the whole thing, not even a drop remaining.

The man immediately got drunk.

Walking a bit further, he suddenly got really hungry.

“Is there nothing to eat?” He glanced around. The whole village was sleeping.

It was still a while before he arrived home and really wanted to eat now. Then he spotted a really plump chicken sleeping in a cage behind a house.

“That chicken looks really good.” Yhe man said as he jumped over the fence.

Lifting up the axe he found nearby, he chopped off its head.

Luckily, the backyard had a kitchen. Plucking off the feathers, he threw it in a pot of boiling water.

“Ah, now that hits the spot.” The man said as he rubbed his belly. Only bones were left of the plump chicken.

Hearing the commotion in her backyard, the house owner went out to investigate.

“My chicken\!” She said upon spotting the blood-soaked man. “You killed my prized pet\! Guards\!”

Not wanting to get in trouble, he assaulted her, making her stay quiet. The men in the village often discussed which lady was the prettiest, and this woman always ended on top of their lists.

*I can’t let a chance like this slip away?* He thought to himself, and unbuttoned his pants.

With the deed done, he found himself in a pickle. What if she were to report him the next day? It was then he got a brilliant idea. He picked up his axe again.

The sun had peeked over the mountains when he finally arrived home. Slipping into the bed, his wife woke up.

“Where have you been all night?”

“Oh, I had to help out someone”

“You always do that.” The wife said and fell back asleep.

“A good story, no?” The monk commented. “A drunk person will lose all reason and do whatever their instincts tells them to do”

“I don’t know.” I said “Would some alcohol really make someone do all that?”

The monk chuckled. “You may still be a bit too young to understand”

“May you all be blessed\!” The booming voice snapped me out of my thoughts. 

The sermon ended and the dozens of people started streaming out of the church. We went the opposite way.

“What a surprise to see you here today, Gale, something good happened?”, the headpriest smiled. 

I could see my father clench his fist. “Good to see you too, father. We were wondering if we could meet with the priest who paid us a visit a few days ago?”

“What’s with the hastiness?” The priest slowly closed the holy book and dragged his feet away from the altar. “How about we chat over a cup of tea?”, he motioned with his arms to the door at the back.

“It’s quite all right, thank you. We don’t want to take up more of your time than necessary”

The priest stood still for a moment, still smiling. “What a shame I just got these new tea leaves from Barre, it's not often you get things from the capital here you know?” He thought for a second. “You must be talking about the father who joined us recently.”

“Speaking of which, he consulted with me on an interesting matter of his” He turned his head away and stared at me. His jovial expression was still plastered on his face. 

“Hmm, I see. It is as he said”  
Something gold flickered in his eyes as my father stepped forward to shield them from me. 

“Sorry about, a force of habit”, he raised his hands up, “he should be in the library.”

The priest left first through the door leaving us behind. 

“They are still hard to converse with wherever it is.” My father sighed. “I will be back soon”. And so only I and my mother were left.

“Want to go visit the park?” My mother bent down to talk to me, “I heard they got some new pretty flowers\!”

The smell of flowers tickled my nose as I strolled around holding my mothers hand. Roses the size of my hand and hydrangeas in all kinds of colors lit up the well-trodden path. 

“I wonder if we could take some home with us”, she studied the peonies, “don’t you think it would spruce up our home, Esther?”

“Yeah, they are pretty.” I couldn’t care less about flowers. They cost too much and I had seen enough of them already.

We sat on a bench, watching the church.

“Mom”, I asked, “would you rather I had my memories back?”

“What are you talking about sweetie?” She furrowed her brows. I hope she doesn’t get wrinkles in the future.

“Isn’t that the real reason why we are here? To ask for a cure?”.

“Well…” It looked like she tried to find the right words. “You know we will always love you, right?”

I nodded.

“We just figured that you may be a bit sad not knowing all the things we are talking about.” She looked at me.

“I’m not.” I turned away from her gaze. “It’s kinda fun learning new things everyday”.

I didn’t need to look to figure out what expression she had. She wrapped her arms around me and gave me a hug.

“Esther\!” Someone shouted my name.

“Let's play together\!” It was Karrie wearing a dress. Her untanned shoulders peeked at me. She also seemed to get dragged to church.

I got permission to play for a bit and went over to where Karrie was waving. 

“Are you still getting hugs at your age?” 

“I like them, it warms my heart”

“Wow… I still can’t believe how different you are…”

“Really, how did I act before?”

“Uhm”, she hesitated, “it didn’t look like you liked you mom that much”

“That’s ridiculous, was I stupid or something?”

“Yeah, I thought so too\! Your mom is ten times nicer than mine”

Karrie told me more things about Esther, like her favorite color and how she never looked to have fun whenever she played. Karrie seemed to like this Esther better.

“Hey, lets go find some cool insects”

“How do you do that”

“Oh right, you just need to find a really big rock and lift it.” She motioned with her hands. “I saw some really big ones behind the church\!”

Following her, I looked at my mother as she disappeared from my view. She had taken a nap. 

“This one will do.” Turning over a rock, a bunch of insects scrawled around as their home had disappeared. I took note of a particular worm as it squirmed there in the dirt. It was disgusting how it looked as it twirled into itself in a continuous motion. Was the bright midday sun burning it? Why don’t you just dig downwards instead, you incompetent worm. Would I have done the same thing had I been reincarnated as it instead?

I tried stabbing it with a stick and it squirmed away, seemingly unharmed. I stabbed another one, same thing happened. I can’t even kill a single stupid insignificant worm.

“Whoah, look at that beetle\!”

I refocused my eyes.

“I bet ya it will stink twice as much,” She seemed to enjoy herself as she upturned rock after rock, looking for the biggest beetle. 

“What are you dumb girls doing?” Someone interrupted our playing.

Strutting toward us was a tall moss-headed boy and another boy trailing behind him.

“Ugh, it’s Finn and his sidekick”

“Who’s that?”

“Someone annoying, just ignore them.” She turned away from them.

“Hey\! I asked you a question\!” Moss-boy demanded

The other boy spoke up. “Bro, why are we even talking to them? Let’s go find some cool sticks\!”

“I don’t care about some dumb sticks\!” He suddenly roared. 

“But you said-”

Finn threw his hand over the other boy’s mouth.

“Are you two done with your comedy routine?” Karrie rolled her eyes.

“You\!” The green boy pointed at her. “Why are you with Esther?”

“It’s Nonya”

“What’s Nonya?” The other boy asked.

“None of ya business\!” Karrie guffawed to herself.

“Thats not funny\!” 

Crossing his arms he turned to me. “Esther, you shouldn’t hang out with her.” 

“Why not?”

“Don’t you remember? She was the one spreading those rumours”

“What rumours?” 

“Hey\!-” Karrie tried to interrupt him. 

“That you always pretended to be sick to get attention”

“Stop\!”

“That you stole all her friends, and that you are a selfish person”

I looked toward Karrie, it seemed like it was true.

“Esther, I didn’t really mean what I said-”

“Yeah right.” Finn interrupted. “You shouldn’t hang out with those types of people.” He reached his hand toward me. 

“I didn’t believe those rumours at all you know? You should hang out with someone with a good personality like me instead” His cheeks reddened a little as he said that.

*I see.* 

“No thanks.” I said flatly. Finn’s hand dropped a little. “I’d rather play with Karrie.”

“What? Why?” 

“I don’t like stupid boys”

“I’m not stupid\!” He defended himself. “My dad’s the captain\!”

“Mom said I’m stupid.” The stupid boy said stupidly.

“I don’t care about what your mom said\!”

Frustrated, he began storming off. “You are going to regret this, I’m gonna tell my dad you rejected my sign of goodwill\!”. 

“Bro wait up\!”.

And so the two boys came and went like a storm, bringing only our mood down. 

“Karrie.” I turned to her. She had been silent for a while now. She looked downtrodden.

I turned to Karrie, she had been silent for a while now. “Karrie,” I called out. She looked at me with a conflicted expression

“The truth is, I’m not the real Esther. So you don’t need to feel guilty for what you said about her.”

Karrie’s eyes blew up like a pair of plates.

“What?” She looked shocked. 

“What a bad joke…”
