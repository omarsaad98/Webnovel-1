# Chapter 8

“Honey, wake up”

“Hmm?” I felt my body shaking.

“Gale get up”

“What is it?” Five more minutes…

Smack\! My face got slapped.

“Galen Nikodemus\!”

“Wh-what is it?” 

“I can’t find Esther\!” Victoria seemed about to cry.

“What do you mean, isn’t she in bed?”

“She isn't\!" She was panicking.

I leapt out of bed, running to my daughters room. It was empty.

“Esther\!” Victoria began running around, throwing open the other doors, checking the rooms.

I called out to her. “Victoria”

“Esther\! Please come out\!”

“Victoria\!” I shook her by the shoulders, making her face me.

“She’s not here”

“What do you mean?” She stared blankly.

“I can’t sense her with my mana”

Victoria went quiet. She steeled her face.

“Can you find her?”

“Don’t worry” I began packing up my gear. “I will find her no matter what”

After ensuring that our vicinity was safe, I led Victoria to our neighbor, explaining to them the situation. Although shocked at first, they ushered my wife inside.

I closed my eyes and began focusing my mana into my eyes. I didn’t like to use this wretched technique but the situation called for it. Opening my eyes, the world lit up. The faint glow of countless colored lights filled my view. I focused on the golden lights, the color of my daughter. The glowing footsteps were pointing towards the town. Esther, where did you go in the middle of the night? 

I began sprinting, the moon at my back.

\*\*\*  
“Stop\!” It hurt.

“Stop it\!” It really hurt.

“Why should I?” The man stared at me. “You tried killing my son\!”

“Ahhh\!” The hammer crushed another one of my fingers.

“No one touches my son without my permission\!”

Why, why why why.

“Shhhh, don’t cry little girl.” He put his hand on my head. “You deserve this”. Pat, pat. 

I deserve this?

“You know that right?”

“Huh?”

“Tsk, you still don’t get it.” He raised his hammer again.

I don’t get it, do I really deserve this? Why do I deserve this? I just wanted to have a normal life. 

My shriek filled the room as my middle finger got crushed.

The hammer clattered to the floor. “That should be enough.” 

He went to the wall. I want to see Victoria. He picked up a knife. I want to taste her cooking again. He took a step closer. I want her to give me a hug again.

“Mom…” I really don’t want to die.

“Don’t you worry”, he raised his knife, “you will be able to meet her soon”

I’m sorry mom. I can’t stop crying. I promise I will stop. Please forgive me.

The knife flew towards my neck stabbing into it. I felt nothing. 

A thud sounded from below my tied legs. Wrenching open my teary eyes, I saw the knife laying there, the hand still gripping it.

“You bastard\!”

He flew across the room into the wall. Gale was standing there sword in hand. My dad had arrived.

“You dare touch my daughter\!” The blade flew through the air, slicing off another hand. It didn’t even leave a shadow.

He let out a pained roar. “My hands\!”

“Shut your mouth\!” His head flew backwards, a few teeth hit the ground.

“S-shtop\!”

Dad slashed with his sword. The left leg got severed.

“W-wait\!”

Another slash, another leg.

“You bastard\! Do you know who I-”

“You goddamn demon\!”

The blade sliced through the air, through his neck, sending his head flying. Rolling on the bloodied floor, his eyes were still open in shock.

“Esther\!” He turned toward me. Blood had spattered all over his clothes and face.

“Oh my goddess, let me get you out of here.” He began untying my hands and legs.

“Dad…”

“It’s okay, I’m here, It’s okay.”

“It hurts…”

“You’re fine, don’t you worry”. He picked me up into his arms.

“I thought I was going to die…”

“You’re not going to die, I’m here.”

“I don’t want to die\!” I cried into his arms.

The incident threw the whole town into chaos. The captain of the guards had died, his body displayed in the middle of town square for all to see. The townspeople started protesting, demanding the capture of the Executioner. The Baron had to listen to the people, lest be trampled under their angry mob. Resultingly, a bunch of guards from the surrounding towns and cities got sent to Guillain. 

My dad had investigated the secret area and found a field of growing flowers, white lilies were blooming in the dark underground. I had been caught by that very same serial killer. The guards concluded the town-wide search and concluded that he had fled the town after seeing the number of guards. The angry townspeople reluctantly accepted this, and the following incident-free days seemed to reassure them. The town was in a joyous mood.

Finn had disappeared somewhere, but I couldn’t care less. Karrie and Eric had a hypothesis that he also got taken by the Executioner, which I couldn’t help but find funny.

And so a month had passed. The leaves were turning brown and thin summer dresses changed into jackets and coats. My fingers on my left hand could still not fully bend and scars marred my skin where the hammer had hit. 

My mom had calmed down considerably, now only hovering around me occasionally. A sad expression crept onto her face each time she saw my hands, making me want to start wearing gloves. Hearing this she only got sadder, but she still made me a thin pair.

Sitting with my hands clasped in my lap, I glared at the statue towering over me. What’s so funny? The marble face smirked at me. I felt my anger rising. 

We were visiting the church today. Dad had asked, or demanded, that the head priest use his healing magic on me. He had a more sizable amount of divine mana and could therefore use a higher grade healing spell. The always smiling priest had frowned for a moment as my body rejected the spell. He remarked how he now knew how the other priest felt.

The sun streamed through the stained glass, blinding me in the eyes. Why was I reincarnated? Was this even a reincarnation? I took over someone’s body and still had my old memories. The monks at the temple said that life was like a wheel, neither a start nor an end existed. Is that why I have my memories? Nothing made sense. Frustration began building up.

I felt my face twist. And why did my knife just bounce off of that kid’s neck? The plan was perfect, there were no holes. If the golden circles hadn’t stopped me from piercing my dagger through his neck, then he wouldn’t have had the chance to retaliate. He should have had his jugular cut, resulting in him bleeding out within three minutes. I touched my stomach, it was still stinging a bit.

“Is this your doing?” My voice echoed in the empty prayer room. Silence.

“Why did you send me here?” The goddess just looked at me, smugly.

“What am I supposed to do\!” I stood up.

“I don’t understand.” I said.

“I don’t understand\!” 

The sun stood behind the statue, making a halo out of its uncaringly shining rays.

“Don’t you look at me like that, wipe that goddamn smile off your face\!”

Her gaze pressed me down to my knees. The smell irritated my nose.

“Say something… anything…”

“I didn’t ask to be reincarnated…” My fists fell to the floor..

“I can’t even kill anyone in this life\!” Thumps sounded from the carpeted floor.

“I can’t do this…” Tears rolled down from my face, staining the blood-red carpet. “Tell me what to do…”

“Esther\!” Victoria ran over to me, finding me splayed out in front of the statue.

“What’s wrong?” She hugged me there on the floor.

I pressed my face into her arms. “Mom…” 

“What is it sweetie? It’s okay, just tell me”

“I want to go home…”

“Of course, we will go home right away.” Her fingers ran through my hair. 

“My sweet little Esther”

\*\*\*  
Today was my birthday, or more correctly, it was Esther’s birthday. Sugar was hard to come by so the small cake in front of me was a bit surprising. Mom had splurged a bit with some help from our neighbor, Karrie's family, and baked a cake. It was a simple thing but it tickled my heart nonetheless.

Invited to my first ever birthday party and Esther's fourteenth party were: my parents, Karrie’s parents, Karrie, and Eric. We had gotten much closer these past months. The cold had seeped in and the naked trees were covered in fluffy white snow. 

“Congratulations Esther\! May the goddess watch over you\!” Karrie said enthusiastically. Yeah, no thanks.

“What are you gonna wish for?” Eric asked.

Dad answered instead of me. “Of course she will ask for money\!” 

“What are you saying?” Karrie’s dad asked. “A growing girl only has one thing to wish for, gems\!”

“Oh, you’re right”

Karrie’s mom let out a sigh. “You two…”  

“What are you going to wish for?” My mom asked. 

My wish? I’ve never wished for something before. I felt my eyebrows scrunch together. I glanced through the room. Dad and Karrie’s dad were busy arguing on what a girl wanted to wish for. The sighs got louder the more they argued. Karrie and Erik were busy not trying to puke their dinner out. And my mom, with her pretty blue eyes, was busy looking at me. The whole room smelled of cake. It’s sweet smell made me smile a little. I only had one wish on my mind right now.

“My wish…” The room went quiet.

The corners on my mouth turned it into a big smile. The air, warmed by the warmth of the people present, was refreshing as it enveloped my teeth. “My wish is to always have happy days like this\!” 

I picked up the knife using my right hand and cut into the cake. Applause painting the background as I prepared a slice. 

“Excuse me”. Someone had knocked on the door. “Let me go check who it is.” My dad said.

“Raviel? What are you doing here?” It was the lady with the bow that had hired him. She didn’t have the bow with her today.

“I have come here today as a messenger”

“A messenger?” My dad grasped the letter handed to him.

“I shall take my leave then.” She grabbed the side of her skirt, threw a leg back, and bent her knees. It was a perfect curtsy. “My lord” 

By the time I blinked, dad had already grabbed her by the neck, lifting her off the floor with one hand.

“Who sent you?” His murderous aura filled the room, pressing us into silence. 

Raviel didn’t seem distressed in the least.

“Duke Nikodemus”

She closed her eyes.

“Your father.”

I could hear something crash as she uttered that last part. Dad had thrown her on the floor. Gale Nikodemus, that was my father’s name. Son of the Duke of North.
