# Chapter 7

I threw a pebble at the window and watched as it made a clinking sound, bouncing off into the moonlit grass. Making sure the house had gone quiet, I snuck out. Staying still after that magnificent sight yesterday? I couldn’t. I threw another pebble at the second floor window. This should be his room. 

Bending down to pick up another pebble, the window finally opened. A welcome face peeked out.

“Esther?” He rubbed his eyes. “Why are you throwing pebbles?”

“I want to talk to you”

“Right now?” Finn glanced at the moon. 

“It’s cold out here.” 

Hearing something plink at his window, Finn woke up after the third time it happened. With heavyset feet, he shuffled to the window, opening it. He thought it was one of the boys always hanging out with him. Instead, under his window stood someone unexpected. It was Esther. Her golden hair glistened in the moonlight. She was about to throw another pebble until she noticed him.

“Ah, there you are." She said cheerfully.

“Esther? What are you doing here?” It was in the middle of the night.

“Come down, I want to talk with you”

“Right now?” Finn was about to refuse, hadn’t it been Esther who asked. “Give me a second”

What did she want to talk about? His heart rate rose a bit higher. With a light gait, he left his room, listed down the stairs; careful not to wake up his dad, and finally arrived at the front door. He grabbed the door handle. As the mechanism in the door began to operate, clicking sounds reverberated across the entrance. Esther was already in front of the door, waiting, smiling. 

Finn couldn’t help but let out a yelp as she had been closer than he thought. 

“Did I scare you?” Her crescent moon shaped eyes sparkled.

“Not really…”

“Come follow me\!” The words flowing from her soft lips felt almost enchanting. 

Finn followed after the girl. “Where are we going?” 

“Just a bit further?” She said without turning.

“What do you mean?” They had walked quite the distance. “What did you want to talk about?” Wasn’t the boy supposed to be the one asking the girl out?

She finally stopped. They were standing in the middle of the forest.

Finn had often played in this very forest, sometimes even camping outside with his dad. They had liked this place since it was so quiet. Esther glanced around.

“This looks like a good spot”

“A spot for what?”, he felt his heart thumping, almost wanting to jump out of his chest. Was this really going to happen?

“I have a confession I want to make”, she hid her hands behind her back. 

Oh, my goddess. Calm down. His palms were sweaty, his knees felt heavy. Play it cool, Finn.

“W-what is it?” Damn it, his voice cracked.

“I think you already know.” She smiled shyly. “Close your eyes for me?”

Done, eyes closed. He could hear her soft footsteps inch closer and closer. 

“You know Finn…” She trailed the last sound of his name. “I really. Really, really. Hate people like you\!” A sudden sharp feeling poked at his throat, throwing him over backwards. Opening his eyes in shock, Esther was standing there. The dagger she held glinted in the moonlight.

What? Why didn’t it pierce his neck?

“Huh?”, the boy on the ground said stupidly. “Did you just stab me?” He was touching the spot where I had thrusted. 

“Stay away\!” He crawled backwards as I came closer “I mean it\!” Eventually hitting one of the many trees in this forest.

I stood between his sprawled out legs and lifted my dagger. It flew swiftly through the damp forest air, arriving at his neck again.

“Aaa\!”

It bounced off. Something yellow had appeared for a second.

I stabbed again”

It bounced off again. It was a yellow circle.

Finn looked at me with a shocked expression before giving me a grand kick to my gut. I could see the air turn flip over, the knife flying in my periphery. 

I let out a groan as the air escaped my lungs. Some dirt had gotten into my mouth.

“You’re crazy\!” He stood up. “You’ve gone insane\!”

I’m not insane. 

“What do I do, what do I do?”

“Dad, I have to wake up dad\!”

Digging into the dirt with my hands, I tried to lift my body off the ground. Something approached and slammed into my head. My mind went blank.

“Wake up sleepyhead, class’ done already.” 

Where am I?

“Hellooo? Earth to \*\*\*”

“Karrie?” What’s she doing here?

“Karrie? Who’s that? I’m Ann, your one and only friend. Did you have a stupid dream or something?”

I glanced around, it was my old classroom.

“Whats the date?”

“Wow, gross. Did you read too many books again? It’s 20XX”

“That can’t be…”

“What do you mean?” Ann tried to balance a pencil on her nose.

“I killed you, you are supposed to be dead”

“Oh, right”

The scene changed. Ann was currently laying in a casket. Her family and friends were gathering around us. The funeral hall was filled with an uncountable amount of flower crests. The smell irritated my nose.

“Tell me”, Ann stared at me with her brown eyes.

“Did you really have to kill me?”

She was smiling.

“You did well my son. Just go back to sleep. Your old man will sort out this misunderstanding."

I couldn’t see.

“It wasn’t a misunderstanding\! She tried to kill me\! Look\!”

My head ached.

“Finn, go back to your room.”

“But Dad\!”

My hands were tied.

“I won’t say it twice”

He paused. “What are you going to do”

“Go to your room”

The sound of footsteps could be heard walking away from us. A door opened and slammed shut.

“I know you are awake, kid.”

“Where am I”

“Somewhere secret.” He answered. “Oh I almost forgot”

The thing covering my eyes disappeared. A singular lamp lit up the room. There were a bunch of tools hanging on the wall. This place looked to be some carpenter’s working area.

“You’re surprisingly calm for being tied up.” The middle aged man said. He looked like an older version of Finn.

“What do you want?” Something white caught my attention. White lilies. “Are you going to kill me?”

“Ha ha\! Quick on the uptake I see”, he flashed me a creepy smile.

I tried to break from my bondage.

“Ah, ah ah\!” He sang while wagging his finger. “Don’t waste your energy, no one has broken free before\!” He seemed proud.

“Does your son know about your disgusting side?” There had to be a way out of here. 

“Oh he knows. But you are mistaken, it's not disgusting”, he stared into my eyes.

“What? Chopping off their heads is not disgusting?” I scoffed.

“They deserved it.” he stated matter-of-factly.

“I see”, my arms were getting heavy, “you’re just insane.”

“Yeah? If I’m insane, then what of you? My son told me you tried to kill him\!” His face twisted into something ugly. Some spit landed on my face.

“It’s personal”

“Hah\! Is that right? Personal.” He picked up a hammer. “Would it be personal if I paid your mother a visit? What was her name, Victoria?” He licked his lips. And then suddenly his face twisted again.

“Damn vixen\! Always flaunting herself everywhere she goes\! Who does she think she is\!” He picked up some nails.

“That’s right, I can just pay her a visit. A personal one.” 

“Don’t…” I mumbled.

He took a step closer. “What was that?”

“Don’t…” He turned his ear toward me. “Don’t you fucking dare\!” Using all my might, I slammed his head with my own. I ended up falling over together with the chair. 

“You touch and I will kill-”

“You bitch\!”, he landed a kick to my stomach, the tip of his shoe digging into it.

“Ugh\!”, some of my spit flew out.

“That does it, after I’m finished with you”, my vision changed as my hair got yanked, “Your pretty little mother is next.”

He pulled me up, chair and all. I had to get out of here, Victoria was in danger. I have to at least tell Gale. The hammer he was holding was positioned above my hands. 

“Wait”

The hammer ascended higher. He was grinning.

“Wait, stop\!”

“Too late\!”

Slam\! My index finger got smashed.
