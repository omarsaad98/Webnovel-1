# Chapter 1

Standing there in front of the statue, I couldn’t help but glare at it. It was a gold-plated statue of a buddha. A master craftsman had probably sculpted it, declaring it his life’s work, getting praised by all the monks visiting. But all I felt as it stood there, towering over me, was irritation. Its expression seemed to be mocking me. A perfectly symmetrical smug smile. 

I had been shot. Pressing down on the wound in my abdomen did little to stop the warm trail of blood sliding down my legs, staining the wooden floorboards in the process. The smell of incense invaded my nose, the same way the flashing red and blue lights invaded through the shuttered windows, painting away the darkness. 

The sirens were still blaring and occasional shouts could be heard surrounding this secluded temple. A familiar voice echoed through the night through the help of a megaphone.

“You are surrounded\! Come out with your hands up\!” 

It was the detective that has been chasing me for the past few weeks. 

I had a nagging feeling of being watched and got my suspicions confirmed when he showed up at the temple. He had asked me a bunch of questions but not once did he write down my answers. He just stared at me. I couldn’t help but stare back at his peculiar scar over his left eye.

In this bustling concrete jungle of a city, stood a lonesome temple on the outskirts of top of a hill. Instead of skyscrapers surrounding it, trees and plants did instead. Having nowhere else to go, I eventually found myself standing before this very place. A monk sweeping the grounds had greeted me, introduced himself and then broke out into a long winded lesson, regaling the history of the temple. 

Did I ask for this service? No. Did I ask him to stop? No, of course not. This happened more often than I would admit, someone finding me and blathering on and on about this or that. He looked increasingly more cheerful the more he talked, hitting all the bullet points. I must have been the only one that listened to his whole presentation.

Having learnt all the ins and outs of the temple, the monk invited me to have a meal as a reward. Having nothing but the shirt on my back, I accepted. Stuffing my face with food for the first time in a while, my body just wanted to lay down and sleep. Noticing this, the monk offered me a room to use, perhaps noticing my predicament. I, a young girl, had just wandered into a temple with nothing.

The room was intended for monks-in-training but no one had shed their modern life in recent years. The room had a mattress and that was it. It was bare. It was like looking into a mirror. I accepted the room.

The sounds of heavy footsteps came closer and closer and the silhouettes obstructed the windows. Glancing down at my blood-stained knife, I debated which way to die was less painful. Stabbing myself in the neck, or getting shot by those standing over there.

The monks at the temple were a little surprised when they saw that a new face had popped up overnight. They began chatting with me immediately, debating to each other about this or that while I stood there, watching. When I had opened my mouth and told them that I wasn’t a new monk in training, I expected them to be a little disappointed. They just smiled gently at me instead.

There were two things stopping me from becoming a real monk-in-training. One, I couldn’t follow the base five precepts. I had already committed one of them. The other reason had something to do with this room, the room with the big statue.

This was my first time in this room. I had tried to enter before but each time, as if some invisible barrier had formed, I couldn’t cross the boundary of the doorway. The golden statue acted like some talisman, protecting itself from me. But strangely enough, I had no problems entering today, my bloody footprints painting a path across the wide floor.

“Death is not the end, nor is life the start. We will all suffer while under the effect of the wheel of reincarnation.” A monk said to me one day. I didn’t really want to die but the thought of reincarnating again seemed to fill me with hope. Maybe I will be a cat in my next life? Laying about and sleeping whenever, or I could be a bird? Spreading out my wings and gliding through the open air. 

My consciousness flickered in and out as I laid there in front of the statue. In the end, I couldn’t choose how I died. I just bled out with the glowing statue smiling down at me.

\*\*\*

“Detective, is this really her? The one making waves in the headlines lately?”

The officer couldn’t help but ask after seeing the dead body of the girl. He had a daughter about her age. All she did was chat with her friends on the phone and staying up all night.  

“Don’t let her appearance fool you, we already have three confirmed bodies”

“Really? You really can’t judge a book by its cover. How did a girl like her turn into a ruthless killer?” The officer took a picture. “She must have been possessed or something, look at this place. The statues give me the creeps, I tell you” He rubbed his arms.

“Enough chatting, wrap it up and give me that report. The media and higher ups have been on my ass ever since that incident.”

“What a shame, he was about to retire and all…”

“He had a promotion lined up and all…” The detective left to light a smoke.

“Good riddance.” Draping a sheet of cloth over the girl, the officer began with his report.

\*\*\*  
My hands lit up and I injected the girl with my divine mana. It didn’t work.

“Father\!” The mother looked distraught, “My daughter, she will wake up won’t she? She must be just sleeping, right?”

Having looked over this girl from late morning to late night, I could only come to one conclusion. Her daughter won’t be able to open her eyes again.

“I’m sorry… it’s not working…” Divine magic was supposed to heal all except for a few cases. Cases where the patient was going to die no matter what. I had expended all of mana.

“She doesn't have long…” 

It was never easy telling a parent about the fate of their child. The woman wailed as she held unto her dying daughter.

“You should start the ritual”. The goddess had given us magic and rituals to help us live. The ritual would ensure a safe passage for a person’s soul on its destination to the pearly gates.

“No\!” She cried. “I won’t do it\! She’s not dead\! My baby, open your eyes please\!”

She grabbed my garment, pleading. “You can use healing magic can't you? Why isn’t it doing anything?\!”

I stayed silent.

Even if divine magic couldn’t turn a terminal ill person into a healthy person, it should still have had some effect. But each time I tried to inject her with mana, it simply bounced off. She must already be dead.

“Oh my baby, please open your eyes. What am I supposed to do without you\!”

The plethora of plants and medicines sprawled across the room, seemed to tell about the girl’s long struggle against her body. Hearing what the mother said, I couldn’t imagine how it must have been living with an unknown incurable disease. Being bedridden whenever she walked too far, getting life endangering fevers for no reason, and not being able to retain her food. What a pitiful life this child has lived.

At least she seemed to be at peace laying there on the bed. A sharp contrast to the haggard looking mother, despair evident on her face. Her golden blonde hair laid to her sides. Her mother had combed it, holding onto whatever hope she had for her daughter. Probably expecting her to wake up any moment now. Apart from her hair, she also inherited the color of her eyes. The pair of brilliantly blue eyes reflected the light from the magic-powered lamp and stared at her mother. They could almost be mistaken for being sisters. Hmm? Staring?

“What am I to tell your father\!” Her tears dropped onto the girl's cheek, leaving a trail as it plopped onto the pillow.

“What…”

Flinching from the unexpected sound, her tears stopped in their tracks. 

What? How is this possible?

“Oh my goddess\!” She let out a yell full of joy. “My baby\!”

“A miracle… This must be a miracle…” I have just witnessed a real miracle. I must document this.

I rummaged through my bags to find something to write on, and while the mother hugged her child shedding tears of joy, the words from the little girl stopped us both from moving.

“Who are you?” A hoarse voice called out.

\*\*\*

The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was a beautiful crying woman. An angel? That can’t be. I can’t be in heaven. The woman seemed to be shocked about something. Her expression mirrored the expression of the man next to her, who wore some really gaudy white clothes reminiscent of the priests that had visited the temple. 

Didn’t I die? I tried to ask them but my voice failed to make a sound. Glancing downwards the view shocked me. This wasn’t my body. As I thought of moving my hand, a small childlike hand moved accordingly instead. An unnatural gold-colored hair flowed by the sides of my view and my chest had gotten a bit smaller… 

This must be a dream, but the aches in my body soon banished that thought. Everything hurt as I laid there in the bed. The pain was even worse than being shot.

Using all the strength I could muster, I focused my attention on the woman. “Who are you?” Even my voice was different. 

I stared absentmindedly at the bowl of porridge in my hands. The warmth from it seeped through my hands, heating up my body a little. Its grayish color didn’t exactly whet my appetite but as the flying spoon flew toward my mouth I had to accept it nonetheless. 

*One shouldn’t judge a book by its cover,* I remembered hearing someone say. A subtle sweetness enveloped my tongue as the porridge spread through my mouth and down my throat, warming it up.

She looked at me with crescent moon shaped eyes. “How is it?” 

“It’s good” My childlike voice rang out. “What is it?” 

“I’m glad”, she said with a big smile, “it’s oat porridge, I used to make it whenever you would get sick”. I accepted another spoonful from her.

This woman was supposedly my mother. A pretty woman with golden hair the same as mine and brilliant blue eyes reminiscent of a cloudless blue sky. Her youthful stature would make one wonder if she was a actual mother, her age doesn’t show at all.

According to this woman, Victoria, my name was Esther, 13 years old. I had been struggling with illnesses my whole life but it was especially bad this time, even putting me on the edge of death. The priest had said that it was a miracle as someone not accepting healing magic was a sure sign of death. Although he had no answers as to why I didn’t have any memories.

Healing magic. Magic. I don’t really know what to expect anymore. But I knew for a fact by instinct, that the one that was supposed to be in this body, Esther, was dead. I didn’t feel the need to tell him that. Victoria looked gleefully at the now empty bowl of porridge. 

A day had passed since I’ve taken over Esther’s body. My body still ached all over but speaking had become less of a strain, so I passed the time by asking a bunch of questions to Victoria.

This country was called the Guillain Empire and it was currently year 563 of the imperial calendar. We lived in some town ruled by some baron whose name I couldn’t remember. This doesn’t sound like the earth I knew.

“A planet? Is it some kind of plant?” She was sitting on a chair by my bedside. 

“It’s not a plant, I think, I just remembered the word”

Her eyes were filled with hope. “Really? Do you remember anything else?”

“No, sorry…” 

“Oh, it’s nothing to be sorry about sweetie, lets just take it slow”

She put her hand onto my head and began patting me. It felt oddly comforting. 

“M-mom?” The word got stuck in my throat. “Can I ask another question?”

“Of course\!” She pumped her fists, cheering me on.

“Do I have a dad?”

“Oh…” She looked like a wilted flower.

“He’s on a monster expedition”

“Monsters? They sound dangerous”

“They can be…” She looked out the window. “But don’t you worry a bit my little pumpkin, your father is stronger than he looks\! Why do you think I married him?”  
She began singing his praises. I could tell from the way she spoke about her husband that they were a happy couple.

I searched my memories for some involving my father but quickly stopped. It was a stupid idea. 

“Do you think he will be glad to see me?”

“Why do you say that?” Her concerned face came a bit closer as she held my hands.

“I don’t remember him at all.” Clenching my hands in her own, she pulled me into a hug. 

“It doesn’t matter my baby, we would still love you all the same. There is always time for new memories, and who knows? Maybe your memories will come back tomorrow?”

I could feel the warmth in her words as she hugged me, warming up my own body. A twinge of guilt took its place in my heart, where her body warmth had seeped into. I didn’t want to let go of this warmth. 

# Chapter 2

I could hear the front door open downstairs and a manly voice rang out. My mother was talking to him when a barrage of footsteps sprinted up the stairs.

“Esther\!” A man barged into the room. The first thing I noticed were his clothes. Leather armor outfitted with metal plates and clinking on his belt was a genuine sword.

“Oh, I shouldn’t have left you\!” He held my hand, pressing it against his head as he knelt by the bed. I could smell something familiar coming from him. It was a smell I knew all too well; the smell of blood.

“Are you my father?”

“Oh my Goddess it was true\!” His eyebrows scrunched together as he seemed ready to cry. Not expecting him to answer, I looked toward my mother for the answer. She had entered the room after him and was consoling her husband. 

“Say hello to your father, dear.” 

He was a handsome man. His sharp jawline was devoid of hair and his obsidian eyes were looking at me warmly under his jet-black hair. 

My mother explained to him how after he left for the expedition, she had to call over a priest to heal me. And as it did not work, she had nearly given up hope, before I opened my eyes.

My mother explained to him what had happened after he had left for the expedition. How the priest had said to prepare for a ritual intended for dead people. 

“I knew those people were quacks\!” He bellowed.

“Watch what you are saying\!” 

“Why else would healing magic not work\! They must have sent an unqualified priest\!”  He looked just like one of those demons the temple had paintings of. I never understood why they hung them up.

“I don’t know either, but please calm down.” She pleaded with him. It was only then that he noticed the situation. He hadn’t even taken his armor off.  
He took a moment to collect himself. “So she doesn’t remember anything?”

“That’s right she didn’t even remember me…” Victoria couldn’t stop her emotions from surfacing, breaking out into a sob.

“Oh honey, come here.” Now it was the wife’s turn to be consoled.

I watched them absentmindedly. My heart grew heavy with guilt. Esther, are you watching? How am I supposed to act in this situation?

A new day welcomed me as the rays of sun lit up the room and woke me up. A pleasant smell of plants filled the room. My mother had fallen asleep while watching over me again. She looked exhausted, although the smile on her sleeping face indicated otherwise. Sitting there under the light, the dust being lit looked like stars circling around her.

I decided to get better soon.

From the conversations I could hear the last few days, the main topic seemed to be about money. The priest had refused payment, stating that he couldn’t accept payment for something the Goddess herself did. But our funds were trickling out with the amount of medicine being bought. 

Feeling particularly well in this body today, I decided to snoop around the house a bit. Sneaking past my mother, I went out of the room, careful not to wake her up. The first thing I wanted to see was a mirror. I still haven’t seen myself. I figured the most likely place other than this room would be Esther’s bedroom. I had actually been using my parents’ room ever since I woke up.  

Opening the door, a cozy room greeted me. A bed half the size of the one I’ve been using, a desk with a matching chair under a window pointing towards the forest in the distance. I searched around the desk and found some books placed haphazardly on top. They were all about plants and their effects on the body. Although I had never seen the alphabet being used in these books, I could still understand their meaning. Was this a form of magic?

Feeling tired, I waddled out of Esther’s room and went back into bed, having not achieved my goal. 

Victoria woke up and stretched her arms toward the air. “Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” Her headpats always felt oddly pleasant.

I nodded.

“It looks like your dad is cooking something good.” A delicious scent had filled the house while I did my investigation.

Reflected in the puddle was a face resembling Victoria staring absentmindedly at me. She was pretty. 

My body had gotten much better the past week with all the rest and food. Today I finally got permission to venture outside. Yesterday’s rain had wet the garden, covering every blade of grass with droplets. 

“Esther\!” Victoria was calling from the kitchen window, “Want to give me a hand with breakfast?”

“Coming\!”

Standing up still got me a bit lightheaded, which had become familiar by now.

It was yesterday that my mother suggested I help her with cooking by cutting some vegetables. She probably suggested that seeing that all I did was lie in bed reading the few books available. 

The kitchen had some interesting things. A stone that water magically, literally, flowed out of. A stone that summoned fire, making cooking easier than how it was at the temple. I remember almost burning the kitchen down the first time I tried to cook something. 

“Here cut these carrots into cubes, want me to show you how it’s done?”. It seemed she had gotten used to my amnesia, often asking me whether I knew something or not.

“I think I got it”

It had been a while since I last held a knife. Gripping it with each of my fingers wrapping around the handle, I felt the weight of the knife in my hand. I couldn’t help but involuntarily frown a little. It was a terrible knife.

“Is it too heavy?” My mother seemed to misunderstand. 

“No, it should be fine.” It was not fine. The balance point was in an horrid position, making the energy expenditure horrible. Not to mention the nicks on the edge of the blade. 

Despite my inner complaints, I still made quick work on the carrots, cutting them into suitable pieces. I had eventually taken over the kitchen while living in the temple. I had originally wanted to just make something to give the monks, and upon seeing my knifework, asked me to help in the kitchen whenever I had time. I had a lot of time.

“Did you get better at cutting vegetables?” Oh, did I mess up?

“You must have gotten it from me, my daughter is so talented\!” She couldn’t help but gush and gave me a squeeze.

“Mom, I’m holding a knife.” Mom, mom, mom. I don’t think I will ever get comfortable saying that three-letter word.

“Sorry, sorry, you’re just so lovely\!”

“Are these stars?” Victoria studied one of my pieces. “Pretty cute…”

“I think they taste better as stars.” I placed the knife down.

“Hmm.” She pondered my statement. “Come here\!” 

A full on hugging attack. 

“How is my daughter this cute\!” Sometimes, I don't really understand Victoria. Nonetheless, whenever she hugged me I couldn’t help but feel a bit happier. 

Setting the table for three, my father came down the stairs groggily.

“What’s for breakfast today?” He asked, slumbering toward his seat at the end.

“Vegetable stew and fried potatoes”. We were now all seated. “Phew, you better wash up afterwards. I can practically smell the alcohol coming from you, how many did you have yesterday”

“I didn’t even get to take a sip, some guy spilled his whole cup all over me”. He lifted his spoon toward his mouth. “Wow, is it just me or did your cooking get better lately?”

“It’s a secret ingredient I found lately.” My mother smirked mischievously, as he inhaled the bowl of stew.  

“Poison is it?”

“What nonsense\! Why would I poison the same food as Esther and I are eating”

“She didn’t deny it…” My father murmured to me.

“What you are tasting is the talents of your daughter. She has helped me in the kitchen lately.”

“Really? She did feel more mature lately, but to think my child is now all grown up…” Fake-wiping his fake tears, he gave me a few pats. 

“I should give a gift to my now all grown up daughter, say it and it shall become yours.” He said theatrically, eliciting a chuckle out of his wife.

“I don’t really need anything”

“She really did go and grow up…” Father slumped his shoulders. “How about this?” Rummaging through his pockets, he pulled out a silver coin. 

“Isn’t a silver coin a bit much, honey? You could buy a day’s worth of food with that”

“Wait until you see this.” Leaving the table, he came back with a book in hand.

“I heard you were interested in monsters.” It was a monster lexicon.

“Whoah, thanks\!” I could finally see what the monsters looked like.

“So my daughter likes monsters more than money, noted”

“Where do you keep finding these books? Aren’t they expensive?”

“Don’t worry, I got this for less than that silver coin”

Flipping through a few pages, I understood why my mother didn’t worry too much about her husband going out and slaying monsters. Each page had a picture and a description of a monster. A rabbit with antlers, a deer with four eyes and other animals with an assortment of features either added or subtracted. Well, I guess you could call these weird beasts monsters.

“Speaking of which, you know the people I met yesterday? They had a really good job offer for us. I’m sure a lot of money will be paid out.”

“Really? Who are they?”

He explained how some people from out of town had come here to find something, and needed people to show them the way. They wouldn’t give more details until they finalized the contract. 

“We won’t have to worry about money for a while if my gut instinct is correct\!”

“This sounds too good to be true”, my mother seemed suspicious, “I’ve never heard of guarding duty being well paid”

“Well, by the way she was acting, it seemed like the leader was a noble. *I* would know”

“That makes sense…”

I guess nobles need more protection than necessary. Anyway, how should I spend this silver coin? 

# Chapter 3: Town

“Hey kid, you want to buy something?”

I was currently standing in front of a toady looking street vendor selling meat skewers. I haven’t had grilled meat in a while so following the smell I arrived at this place. 

“Go ask your parents if you’ve got no money”

Three coppers for a skewer. That’s nearly half of what I had. I didn’t like to use money on things like food, but maybe an exception could be made this time. The smell was calling me to be eaten. Opening the coin pouch my mother had gifted me, I was about to take my one silver coin out. 

“Do you want me to buy you one sweetie?” My mother had finally arrived and with her considerably fatter pouch. 

“Can I get one?”

Taking my first bite, the taste surprised me. It tasted amazing, a bit gamey maybe but it only added onto its charm. 

“Is this meat from the four-eyed deer monster?”

“Oh you know about them monsters, kid? You should probably learn monsters aren’t edible”

“They were supposedly poisoned by the goddess to defer us from not seeking them out.” My mother explained.

“Really?” I put the last cube in my mouth. “Wouldn’t it be better to hunt them for food?”

“Worry about yourself, kid. All bones and no muscle, just looking at you makes me want to feed you. Here take another one, on the house.” The toady vendor gave Victoria the side-eye. 

“You’re too kind, sir. My daughter was just bedridden you see…”

The vendor clicked his tongue and began nagging at her, regaling us about how back in his days no children would be as thin as me. I didn’t like his tone of voice. 

“It’s not my mother’s fault, I’m just a picky eater”

“Whatever, scurry off now.” The vendor shooed us away grumpily.

We walked away from the grumpy toady vendor. “Thanks, Esther.” She eyed the skewer in my hand. “I better make something good when we get home\!”. A smile definitely suited her better.

With two empty skewers in one hand, and my mother’s hand in the other, I accompanied her wherever she led me. The sight of the town was quite something. It looked just like a medieval city. Cobblestones laid on our path and carriages with horses could be seen going up and down the streets, clipping and clopping all the while. Passing other people on the street we arrived in front of a shop.  

The town was pretty developed for being an unremarkable town, something my father said. There was a social class system in the Empire. At the top stood the Emperor, below him stood four dukes who each ruled a part of the empire. 

They were divided into the four cardinal directions, each ruling by proxy for the Emperor. We were currently in the East, which meant that Duke Miravele was essentially our ruler. 

The territory was sizable, requiring them to let other lower nobles help them out. The ranking of the noble titles were, Dukes, Marquesses, Counts, Viscounts and then Barons. The lord ruling over this town was a baron. My father didn’t seem all that happy when he talked about him. 

“Why don’t you wait on the bench here?” A bench was set outside the store, shaded by a big leafy tree.

My legs ached a bit so I accepted her preposition. Sitting on the bench and watching the people was entertaining enough. There were some guards walking around with spears in their hand, patrolling the area, people who were haggling with the vendors trying to get the most for their money, but what caught my attention were the striking hair colors. Red, blue, green, a bunch of colors littered the heads of the passerbys. Speaking of, someone with red hair stood in front of me.

“What’s a young lady like you doing here? Never seen you here before”

A young lady, wasn’t that usually used when talking to nobles? Well I did wear a rather pretty dress and a fancy sunhat. Victoria had given me one of hers to protect me from the blinding sun. Anyway, who’s this kid?

“I’m not a young lady, my name is Esther. I’ve never seen you before either”

“Is that so? I’m Eric, I live in that house over there.” He pointed at the house next to the shop. “I’m 14”

Is this how you are supposed to introduce yourself?

“I live outside town, I’m 13”

He smirked. “Looks like I’m older than you”

“Are you lost or something?” He asked.

“I’m waiting for my mom”.

“I see”, the boy took a seat beside me as if it was natural, plopping himself down. He was a whole head higher than me.

“This is boring, wanna go play instead?” It hadn’t even been a full minute before he said something. 

“My mother said to not go with strangers.” 

Victoria didn’t tell me this but the point still stands, I think. *She* didn't really exude a sense of confidence. Besides, playing? 

“I’m not a stranger, I know your name and you know mine. Oh I know.” He rummaged through his bag, eventually pulling something wrapped in paper.

“My dad told me to give a gift to someone to make them your friend. Here take one”

It was hard-candy. Sugar was supposed to be pretty rare so how did this kid get some? Not passing up this opportunity, I unwrapped one and popped it into my mouth. The sweetness felt like it was burning my mouth. It had been a while since I had some sugar.

Smiling, he said. “There, we’re now friends”

“Is that how that works?” I snuck another piece into my mouth.

“Hey, don't take all of them\!” Tsk, he took them away.

“Don’t click your tongue at me\!”

“Who’s this Esther? A new friend?” My mother was finished with her shopping.

“Yeah, he gave me some candy".

“Did he now? Well thank you for that”. Victoria gave him a smile.

“O-oh it was no problem, my lady. My name is Eric. I live over there”. His face nearly turned into the same color as his hair.

“Oh my\! My lady?” She looked happy.

“Mom, can I go play with Eric for a bit?”

“Hmm”, she looked around at the guards, “just meet us by the fountain on the next bell, okay? I will go find your father in the meanwhile”

“You heard her, lets go Eric”

“Huh? Oh, sure”

I took the lead with Eric in tow while my mother gave us a wave. You shouldn't smile like that to other men besides father, I pouted.

“Hey where are you going, that’s the wrong way”

“Really? Where are we even going?”

“Weirdo” Eric gave me a funny look. “This way. All the kids play over there.”

Snaking around some alleys and streets, we arrived into a clearing, where a group of kids were chatting and running around.

“Hey guys\! A brought another one to play with”

“Eric\!” a girl in shorts came running up to us. “I told you to stop bringing over random kids\!”, she said grumpily.

“She’s not some random kid, I befriended her with some candy, isn’t that fine? She looked pretty bored so I took her along.” Rubbing his nose, it looked like he thought he did something heroic. I wasn’t actually bored.

“Ugh, well what’s done is done. I’m Karrie by the way”. 

Tilting my head up to move my sunhat from blocking my view, nothing could have prepared me for the view as the girl greeted me.

“What? What are you doing here?” That’s what I want to ask you.

“You know her?”

“She’s my neighbor. Did you get sick again? Haven’t seen you around lately”

Chestnut-brown hair done in a short bob, a pair of brown eyes and above them, two thin eyebrows framing her face. A vivid image of her laying in a casket filled my head. There was no mistaking it, the name was different but this was definitely *her*. 

“Hello? You home?” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth.

“Oh, sorry. Nice to meet you, I’m Esther. I live outside of town”. 

“What kind of greeting is that supposed to be? And I already know who you are.” Tilting her head to the side. Her eyebrows seemed to question me.

“Is that so? Sorry, I lost my memories a few days ago. I don’t really remember anyone”

“Are you joking? How’s that possible”

“I don’t know, the priest examining me didn’t know much either”

“You called a priest? Must have been serious then…” 

“Whoah, that's so cool\!” Jumping into the conversation was a cheerful looking Eric.

“So you don’t remember anything?” I nodded

“What about your parents, did you remember them?”

“Hey\! What are you saying\!”. Seeing her slap Eric on the back resurfaced some old memories. 

“Oh, when I woke up, I just saw this pretty lady looking at me” 

“Yeah that’s right, she’s really pretty\!”. Eric said, rubbing his back. Tsk.

“Hey, stop clicking your tongue at me\!”

“Well? And then what happened?”

“Hey quit it, look how sad she is getting\!”

Did I? Well this works. I had something I wanted to investigate.

“I don’t really want to talk about it, can’t we play something instead?” 

“Oh right, you said something so shocking I forgot. Any ideas?” 

Shaking her head, Karrie said. “Well, there’s only three of us for now-”

“Wow, you gonna ditch the others?”

“They only do tiring stuff, I don’t want to get all sweaty in this weather. You know anything interesting to do, Esther?”

“I don’t remember”

“Wow… I bet you say that often.” Eric said incredulously. Karrie glanced at me and couldn’t help but agree.

Ridiculous as it sounds, it was the truth, or more correctly, I didn’t know any games. Having never had the chance to play with others, remembering games or fun things to do was just wasted energy I could instead use to survive. Well, there was one game I was subjected to against my will.  

“How about truth or dare?” I spat out.

“You serious?” They said in tandem.

“Sorry, that was a joke…”

# Chapter 4: Playing

“Well I see you still make bad jokes…” She sighed.

“How about a guessing game?” The girl whom I swore should be dead, threw out an idea. It seemed to be perfect for doing a test.

“That sounds fun, how about we guess each other’s drawings.” I picked up a stick nearby and squatted down in the dirt.

“Well I guess that works.” Eric said.

Let’s start with something easy first, something they would guess correctly. A circle for the body and head, a triangle for the beak and wings, and some lines for the feet. Scribbled into the dirt was a bird. I was quite proud of how it turned out.

Eric and Karrie seemed deep in thought as they squatted over the drawing, our head nearly touching. 

“Uhm, Esther?” Eric broke the silence, looks like he will get the first point.

“I have no idea what these shapes are supposed to be”. 

“Yeah, you’re worse than I thought…”

“What are you guys talking about, it’s obviously a bird.” I couldn’t help but feel a bit indignant.

“Look, there's the beak and the wings, and these lines are the feet.” Pointing at my drawing, I explained to them. 

“I still don’t see it.” Eric said after a momentary pause.

“Me neither.” Agreed the girl with the same face as *her*.

What are they talking about? Are they stupid? And since when did you become Eric’s yes-man, just stay dead\!

“Well, let's see how much better you are then.” I said, practically shoving the stick to Eric. 

“No need to get so worked up, Esther” 

I don’t want to hear that from you of all people.

“Hmm, let's see”. With a practiced hand, Eric began drawing in the dirt. First there was a square and then a-

“A sword”

“Correct\! A point to Karrie.”

“What, he didn’t even finish it yet”

“It’s obvious if you have played this before”. Upon realising what she just uttered, clamped her mouth shut. “Sorry, I didn’t mean that”

“Let me try again”

It wasn’t my turn yet but I had to check this before I missed my chance. Getting permission, Eric gave the stick back to me. Let’s see if Karrie also has memories of her past life.

*Ann, aren’t you supposed to be dead,* I wrote it in a language only us could understand. I studied her face as she looked at what I drew.

“Esther”, she called my name hesitatingly. 

“What is it?”

“I think we should switch games, this won’t be fair at this point…”

Looking at what I drew, Eric roared. “Hahaha, what is that?\!”

It wasn’t supposed to be something you would guess\! Her face didn’t even flinch when she looked at it. I still had to do more tests.

Upon my insistence, Eric and Karrie agreed to play a few more rounds. The sun in the sky had dipped a bit at this point and the air was getting noticeably cooler. It was on my fourth drawing that the bell rang in the distance, signaling the end of our game. The other kids seemed to also wrap up their games.

I grit my teeth. “This game sucks.” I threw the stick to the ground. 

“Maybe we should have done something else?” Karrie was standing there with 4 points to her name. “Are you heading back too?” 

“Aw, shucks. Esther, you should play with us next time too. I can't believe you got zero points.” He pointed at me and laughed with his stupid winner-smile. He managed to get 5 points. I didn’t try to win, I had better things to do. I concluded that she and Ann only looked alike. Otherwise her poker face was impenetrable, hah, yeah right.

I marched out of there, stomping my feet in the process, only to have the both of them follow me. 

Not wanting to talk to him anymore, I started my march towards the town square. The only problem being the winding alleys and streets all looked the same. I hadn’t actually paid attention to the directions. My march got halted after a few stomps.

“That’s the wrong way, Esther. The fountain is this way.” He smirked at me. 

Karrie joined us as Eric led the way and so the three of us began our journey through the alleys. Chatting along the way were the two of them, their topics ranged from this to that. Occasionally, I gave an affirmative “Yes” or “I see” pretending to listen as I focused all my strength in my feet instead. They were really sore. 

“Hey did you hear about the Executioner? How dead people keep popping up?” I perked my ears towards Eric.

“I did see that there were more guards than usual lately” 

“Finn said that his dad would give a huge reward to the person that caught him.” 

“Really?” Karrie put her hand to her chin. “How much are we talking about?”

“He said 5 gold coins\!” Eric gestured with his hands.

“Oh my goddess”, feigning shock she said, “and so, you really believe him?”

“Well…”

She shrugged his shoulders. “I can’t remember the last time that daddy’s boy said something true”

“You have a point…”

The fountain came into view as we rounded a corner. Mother had met up with father and were currently talking to a woman. Judging by her bow strapped to her back, it must have been one of the hunters in father’s group.

“Miss Victoria\!” Karrie shouted. “We brought Esther back”

Turning her head to having her name being called, she smiled upon seeing us. “Goodness, there's a whole group of you now.” I could hear Eric mumbling my mother’s name. 

“Oh my, how cute. Are these all your children?” The woman with the bow asked.

“As if, one is more than enough for us.” Father crouched down, meeting me at my eye level. “Did you make new friends already?”. 

“Yeah, this is Eric and Karrie”

The woman looked at me and then my mother. “I see the resemblance. Nice to meet you, I’m Raviel, I work with your dad.”

“Hello, I’m Esther, I live out of town.” My introduction got a chuckle out of her.

“I suppose it is time for the children to head back, same time next week?”

Father confirmed and Raviel left us, blending through the crowd of people.

“I better leave before I get scolded again. See you guys next time, you too, miss Victoria\!” Eric left while waving toward my mother.

“Did that boy just..?” Yes he did, father.

“What a charming boy.” My mother waved back. “Did you come alone today, Karrie? Want to head back with us?”

“If you wouldn't mind.” Karrie said shyly.

With Karrie and I at the front, we began our journey home. It was a wonder how much she could talk by herself. At least she looked happy chatting away. If only she could hear my inner thoughts. 

What would happen if I just killed her again? She wasn’t Ann at the moment, but her face was. Honestly, it was pretty fun playing with them. I enjoyed the experience. *It wouldn’t hurt to just observe her*, I thought to myself, staring at her mouth rapidly opening and closing.

We finally arrived at her house. It looked similar to ours, standing there in the distance. Even the tree in the backyard stood in the same position.

“See ya\! I had fun today, let's play again\!”.

My parents said that they would come visit when the time allowed it, saying farewell to Karrie’s mother, who had come to scold her daughter.

“Was she one of those people who had that idea you were talking about?”

He adjusted the grip on the shopping bag. “Raviel? Yeah, I can’t really tell you all the details.” Raviel’s employer had apparently found a treasure map and needed some experienced people that knew the lay of the land. No one knew this place better than his group and that was why she and her employer had approached them.

“I don’t know about this idea of hers, doesn’t it sound dangerous? Such a high sum just for some guide work…”

“You know how nobles think and act. How about this”, he tried to reassure her, “I will tell my men to immediately run should I sense anything dangerous. This job would bring our coffers back to a comfortable state.” He planted a kiss on the back of her hand. 

“I’m sorry for making you always do all this work…”

“Nothing to be sorry about, I chose to marry you, remember?” That’s weird, I thought to myself. They both said the same thing.

Getting tucked in by my mother became a routine after I had moved rooms. It still felt awkward as I laid there, the blanket covering half of my face. 

“Did you have fun today?”

I nodded.

It was a bit of a commotion when my legs gave out and father had to carry me the rest of the way. She had fretted about the house blaming herself for not taking better care of me. It wasn’t until father comforted her saying that none of it was her fault, that a child had to fall to learn how to pick themself up. 

My mother patted my stomach as she sat there with a somber expression. 

“I drew a bird today”

“Really?”

“They said that I had talent”

“Of course, my daughter is the most talented person in the world.” She planted a kiss on my forehead. 

Her mood always changed whenever something happened to me. Happy, when something good happened. Sad, when something bad happened. Apparent even to me, I could see how much she loved her daughter. I must be a better daughter so that she won’t be sad so often.

She left the room, seeing as my eyes drooped. A lot had happened today. I met someone who already knew Esther, someone who didn’t know her and even got to play with other kids for the first time. The skewers were good and the thought of the sweet candy I snatched from Eric, made the corners of my mouth turn up a bit. 

A sudden realization shook off my drowsiness. I had forgotten my main goal. Laying on top of my desk was my pouch still filled with the ten copper coins. The whole point of me going out to town today was to spend it. I had forgotten my main goal. This had never happened before. I couldn’t decide whether this was a good or a bad sign.

Tomorrow, I would spend some money tomorrow, whatever it took.

# Chapter 5: Church

Sitting on the prayer bench, I couldn’t help but feel a little irked as I stared at the marble statue of the Goddess. Today was the day of the Goddess, the seventh day of the week. 

I had already made out a plan for today. First, wear something comfortable, then go to town, maybe with Karrie if she wanted and then use the whole day to go find something interesting to spend my money on. My plan went into the bin when my mother woke me up and told me to get ready to go to church.

The sight of statues was starting to really annoy me. Towering over us under the stained glass window, it was draped in all kinds of colors. Did they all really need to have such a smug face? I contemplated how high I had to grow to be able to punch it in its face.

The headpriest raised his arms. “And onto us the Goddess bestowed us these five commands\!”. That sounded familiar.

He went on to explain the five rules one had to follow to not be damned: Murder, theft, adultery, lying, and intoxication.

I was taken aback. It was the same as the five precepts the monks used to tell me. 

“Do you know why intoxication, being drunk in other words, is mentioned last?” The monk had said to me once. “You are probably wondering why murder is last, right?”

“Let me tell you a story”

There once was a man living with his wife in a village. He had a good reputation as an upright man, helping whoever needed help and many envied how harmonious his family was.

One day, walking back to his home after a long day of work, he felt really thirsty. The sun had been beating down on him the whole day, making him sweat through his clothes. 

The way back home was quite a distance so he knocked on the houses he passed by to ask for some water.

Knock, knock\!

“Mister, what are you doing knocking on my door this late?” The house owner opened the door.

“Sorry about this, but I’m just feeling so thirsty\! You wouldn't happen to have some water lying about?”

“Water?” The house owner pondered. “It’s a bit late to draw up some water right now, would you like some wine instead?”

“Water or wine, I will take whatever\! I can feel my mouth turning into sand”

And so the man got a bottle of wine. 

The truth is, the man had never had a sip of alcohol before. He had seen other people drink it, and they typically took the whole thing in one gulp. Opening the cork, he drained the whole thing, not even a drop remaining.

The man immediately got drunk.

Walking a bit further, he suddenly got really hungry.

“Is there nothing to eat?” He glanced around. The whole village was sleeping.

It was still a while before he arrived home and really wanted to eat now. Then he spotted a really plump chicken sleeping in a cage behind a house.

“That chicken looks really good.” Yhe man said as he jumped over the fence.

Lifting up the axe he found nearby, he chopped off its head.

Luckily, the backyard had a kitchen. Plucking off the feathers, he threw it in a pot of boiling water.

“Ah, now that hits the spot.” The man said as he rubbed his belly. Only bones were left of the plump chicken.

Hearing the commotion in her backyard, the house owner went out to investigate.

“My chicken\!” She said upon spotting the blood-soaked man. “You killed my prized pet\! Guards\!”

Not wanting to get in trouble, he assaulted her, making her stay quiet. The men in the village often discussed which lady was the prettiest, and this woman always ended on top of their lists.

*I can’t let a chance like this slip away?* He thought to himself, and unbuttoned his pants.

With the deed done, he found himself in a pickle. What if she were to report him the next day? It was then he got a brilliant idea. He picked up his axe again.

The sun had peeked over the mountains when he finally arrived home. Slipping into the bed, his wife woke up.

“Where have you been all night?”

“Oh, I had to help out someone”

“You always do that.” The wife said and fell back asleep.

“A good story, no?” The monk commented. “A drunk person will lose all reason and do whatever their instincts tells them to do”

“I don’t know.” I said “Would some alcohol really make someone do all that?”

The monk chuckled. “You may still be a bit too young to understand”

“May you all be blessed\!” The booming voice snapped me out of my thoughts. 

The sermon ended and the dozens of people started streaming out of the church. We went the opposite way.

“What a surprise to see you here today, Gale, something good happened?”, the headpriest smiled. 

I could see my father clench his fist. “Good to see you too, father. We were wondering if we could meet with the priest who paid us a visit a few days ago?”

“What’s with the hastiness?” The priest slowly closed the holy book and dragged his feet away from the altar. “How about we chat over a cup of tea?”, he motioned with his arms to the door at the back.

“It’s quite all right, thank you. We don’t want to take up more of your time than necessary”

The priest stood still for a moment, still smiling. “What a shame I just got these new tea leaves from Barre, it's not often you get things from the capital here you know?” He thought for a second. “You must be talking about the father who joined us recently.”

“Speaking of which, he consulted with me on an interesting matter of his” He turned his head away and stared at me. His jovial expression was still plastered on his face. 

“Hmm, I see. It is as he said”  
Something gold flickered in his eyes as my father stepped forward to shield them from me. 

“Sorry about, a force of habit”, he raised his hands up, “he should be in the library.”

The priest left first through the door leaving us behind. 

“They are still hard to converse with wherever it is.” My father sighed. “I will be back soon”. And so only I and my mother were left.

“Want to go visit the park?” My mother bent down to talk to me, “I heard they got some new pretty flowers\!”

The smell of flowers tickled my nose as I strolled around holding my mothers hand. Roses the size of my hand and hydrangeas in all kinds of colors lit up the well-trodden path. 

“I wonder if we could take some home with us”, she studied the peonies, “don’t you think it would spruce up our home, Esther?”

“Yeah, they are pretty.” I couldn’t care less about flowers. They cost too much and I had seen enough of them already.

We sat on a bench, watching the church.

“Mom”, I asked, “would you rather I had my memories back?”

“What are you talking about sweetie?” She furrowed her brows. I hope she doesn’t get wrinkles in the future.

“Isn’t that the real reason why we are here? To ask for a cure?”.

“Well…” It looked like she tried to find the right words. “You know we will always love you, right?”

I nodded.

“We just figured that you may be a bit sad not knowing all the things we are talking about.” She looked at me.

“I’m not.” I turned away from her gaze. “It’s kinda fun learning new things everyday”.

I didn’t need to look to figure out what expression she had. She wrapped her arms around me and gave me a hug.

“Esther\!” Someone shouted my name.

“Let's play together\!” It was Karrie wearing a dress. Her untanned shoulders peeked at me. She also seemed to get dragged to church.

I got permission to play for a bit and went over to where Karrie was waving. 

“Are you still getting hugs at your age?” 

“I like them, it warms my heart”

“Wow… I still can’t believe how different you are…”

“Really, how did I act before?”

“Uhm”, she hesitated, “it didn’t look like you liked you mom that much”

“That’s ridiculous, was I stupid or something?”

“Yeah, I thought so too\! Your mom is ten times nicer than mine”

Karrie told me more things about Esther, like her favorite color and how she never looked to have fun whenever she played. Karrie seemed to like this Esther better.

“Hey, lets go find some cool insects”

“How do you do that”

“Oh right, you just need to find a really big rock and lift it.” She motioned with her hands. “I saw some really big ones behind the church\!”

Following her, I looked at my mother as she disappeared from my view. She had taken a nap. 

“This one will do.” Turning over a rock, a bunch of insects scrawled around as their home had disappeared. I took note of a particular worm as it squirmed there in the dirt. It was disgusting how it looked as it twirled into itself in a continuous motion. Was the bright midday sun burning it? Why don’t you just dig downwards instead, you incompetent worm. Would I have done the same thing had I been reincarnated as it instead?

I tried stabbing it with a stick and it squirmed away, seemingly unharmed. I stabbed another one, same thing happened. I can’t even kill a single stupid insignificant worm in this world.

“Whoah, look at that beetle\!”

I refocused my eyes.

“I bet ya it will stink twice as much,” She seemed to enjoy herself as she upturned rock after rock, looking for the biggest beetle. 

“What are you dumb girls doing?” Someone interrupted our playing.

Strutting toward us was a tall moss-headed boy and another boy trailing behind him.

“Ugh, it’s Finn and his sidekick”

“Who’s that?”

“Someone annoying, just ignore them.” She turned away from them.

“Hey\! I asked you a question\!” Moss-boy demanded

The other boy spoke up. “Bro, why are we even talking to them? Let’s go find some cool sticks\!”

“I don’t care about some dumb sticks\!” He suddenly roared. 

“But you said-”

Finn threw his hand over the other boy’s mouth.

“Are you two done with your comedy routine?” Karrie rolled her eyes.

“You\!” The green boy pointed at her. “Why are you with Esther?”

“It’s Nonya”

“What’s Nonya?” The other boy asked.

“None of ya business\!” Karrie guffawed to herself.

“Thats not funny\!” 

Crossing his arms he turned to me. “Esther, you shouldn’t hang out with her.” 

“Why not?”

“Don’t you remember? She was the one spreading those rumours”

“What rumours?” 

“Hey\!-” Karrie tried to interrupt him. 

“That you always pretended to be sick to get attention”

“Stop\!”

“That you stole all her friends, and that you are a selfish person”

I looked toward Karrie, it seemed like it was true.

“Esther, I didn’t really mean what I said-”

“Yeah right.” Finn interrupted. “You shouldn’t hang out with those types of people.” He reached his hand toward me. 

“I didn’t believe those rumours at all you know? You should hang out with someone with a good personality like me instead” His cheeks reddened a little as he said that.

*I see.* 

“No thanks.” I said flatly. Finn’s hand dropped a little. “I’d rather play with Karrie.”

“What? Why?” 

“I don’t like stupid boys”

“I’m not stupid\!” He defended himself. “My dad’s the captain\!”

“Mom said I’m stupid.” The stupid boy said stupidly.

“I don’t care about what your mom said\!”

Frustrated, he began storming off. “You are going to regret this, I’m gonna tell my dad you rejected my sign of goodwill\!”. 

“Bro wait up\!”.

And so the two boys came and went like a storm, bringing only our mood down. 

“Karrie.” I turned to her. She had been silent for a while now. She looked downtrodden.

I turned to Karrie, she had been silent for a while now. “Karrie,” I called out. She looked at me with a conflicted expression

“The truth is, I’m not the real Esther. So you don’t need to feel guilty for what you said about her.”

Karrie’s eyes blew up like a pair of plates.

“What?” She looked shocked. 

“What a bad joke…”

# Chapter 6

I felt like this situation had happened before. 

“It’s not a joke.”

“Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Esther.” She took a deep breath and pointed her gaze at me. 

“But I did really say those things about you…” Her face scrunched up. 

“The truth is, I always wanted to be friends with you, but you were so hard to talk to…” She bowed her head. “I want to apologize\!”

Being on the receiving end of an apology felt weird. I was always the one who apologized. Standing there watching the top of her head, my mind turned still. 

“Ugh, this is so embarrassing\!” Karrie couldn’t take it anymore, her cheeks were red like beets. “Just say whether you accept it or not\!”  

“Oh. Sorry, I accept your apology.” Good save, Karrie.

“No\! Now it just sounds like I forced you\!” Karrie seemed to struggle with something as she hid her face behind her hands.

“It’s fine Karrie” I stared at her face. “I want to be friends with you too”

“Really?” She peeked between her fingers. “Even when I said those things about you?”

“Don’t worry about it, you didn’t talk about me”

“Yeah right…”

“More importantly”, something had scratched at me for a while now, “where does Finn live?”

Karrie opened her eyes wide, she looked betrayed. “Why? Are you going to throw me away?” 

“What are you talking about, I just don’t want to run into him. I don’t want his stupidity spreading”

“Oh…” A nervous chuckle slipped out. “You scared me for a second there\!”

Throwing out a bunch of insults at Finn, Karrie told me what his address was.

“I see,” I gave her the biggest smile I could, “Thanks”.

\*\*\*

I was currently standing in the industrial district where a cacophony of noises could be heard. Black smoke was blooming atop the chimneys of the blacksmiths and the clinking of the armored people could be heard as they went around looking for new gear. 

“This ain’t no place for a younging like you to go play around”. A sooty old man said to me. “Where are you parents, kid”.

The street even had magic-powered street lamps. What a weird juxtaposition of the modern-looking streetlamps and the sweaty men hammering away on their anvils.

“Did you make all the knives yourself?” The knives on display looked really well made. 

The man crossed his arms. “Knives? Never have I ever- these are *daggers*”

I tilted my head. “What’s the difference?” 

Looking exasperated, he staggered around the stall to face me. I had to crane my neck to look at him. 

“The difference, young lady, is that daggers are used for killing things”. Picking up one of the *daggers,* he took a few stabs at the air.

“I see”

“Understood? Now go along, you’re scaring off the other customers-”

“How much for this one?” I pointed to a simple looking dagger.

He scrunched his face. “Didn’t you hear me? These are for killing things”. He gave me a new glance, looking me up and down.

“Five silvers”

I opened the bag Victoria had made for me, it looked like a pocketbook. 

“Do you have anything for one silver?”

He clicked his tongue. “Check that pile over there, rejects, the lot of them.”

The box was piled in the dozens with either bent products or half-finished projects. 

“Made ‘em in my apprentice days”

“Must be really old then.” I remarked.

“I see you got humour in you, kid”

He picked the most decent thing out for me. It was a dagger made of a single piece of metal, it looked like a big toothpick. 

Holding it in my hand I gave it a few swings and stabs. The old man let out an impressed whistle upon seeing my movements. It was well made, this would do.

“You seem to really like it.” He seemed to be enjoying himself.

I tried giving him my silver coin but he stopped me with the palm of his hand. 

“Take it, just pay me back by spreading my name”. He pointed to the letters engraved on the blade, T and K. 

The merchants in this town seemed to like to give me free things. Putting the dagger in my pocketbook, I gave him a curtsy I learnt from Victoria and went on my merry way. Karrie was waiting for me at the end of the street. 

Our family had met up with hers and suggested having a bite together in town. While the adults talked about adult things, after eating at the restaurant, Karrie and I scurried off to look at things.

“I don’t get why you wanted to look around here, Esther. It stinks” The smoke snakes rustled above the roofs.

She turned to her left. “And why are you here?”

Eric had joined up with us. “You guys looked to do something fun\!”

“All’s fun with you isn't it?” She let out a sigh.

“Are you done with this place, Esther?”

I nodded.

“Nice\! Let’s go check out that huge crowd over there\! Eric said excitedly. 

He told us that the Executioner had struck again.

While dragging us with he told us about the killer that had been wrecking havoc in the town the last few weeks. And whenever there was a gathering of guards, it meant a new body had popped up. Finn’s father was directing the other guards.

The guards made a line of no entry, blocking the crowd from the thing they were surrounding. There was a man kneeling on the ground, he seemed to be a farmer judging by his clothes. The thing he cradled in his arms stared at me; a pair of lifeless eyes. Where his head should have been was instead a flower. A white lily stained with blood. The man had been decapitated.

“How horrible…” A woman from the crowd gasped.

“Tsk, of course it's another one of us.” Another working man spat.

“Goddess, please protect us from this demon\!” An old woman broke out into prayer.

The blood had pooled on the rough cobblestones underneath, painting a picturesque scene. It looked almost religious. 

Covering my face in my hands, I could feel the corners of my face twitch.

“Eric, I’m about to puke… Why did you bring us here?” Karrie had lost all color on her face.

“I thought it would be cool…” Eric bit his lips. His usual cheerful self nowhere to be seen. 

“You okay Esther?” Karrie patted my back as I stood there hiding my face. 

Sorry Ann, I don’t want to see your face right now. And I don’t want you to see mine either. My teeth were showing. I squatted down.

“You kids over there\!” The green haired man yelled out to us.

“What are you doing here?” He marched towards us, “Oh is that you Karrie?” His serious face disappeared, a big smile had replaced it. 

“Oh hello sir…” 

“What’s with that greeting? You’re practically my daughter\!” He bellowed.

“Are you playing nice with my son?”

“Yeah, Finn’s really funny\!” Eric said.

Peeking from my spot, I noticed his face twitch a little.

“Is that so?” He beamed. “He’s funny is it?”

“Is your friend over there okay?”

“Oh she’s just feeling unwell, we should head back” I could hear the awkwardness in Karrie’s voice. 

“You kids do that, this isn’t a pretty sight”. His face turned serious again, but I could detect something in his expression, something cheerful.

“Let’s get out of here, Eric. Esther doesn’t look that good” 

Karrie, you’re such a sweet girl.

\*\*\*

“Hello kids, you look like you’ve seen a ghost or something\!” Karrie’s father guffawed. 

“Uh, yeah, ha ha.” Eric replied.

Sitting around the table were our parents chatting away. 

“What happened?” Victoria asked us. 

Seeing that Karrie and Eric didn’t have anything to say, I spoke up. “Do ghosts really exist?”

“‘Course they do\! Why, I saw one myself this one time\!” He was loud.

His wife let out a sigh. “There he goes again…” 

“You don't look well, come sit with me”. Victoria picked me up and put me on her lap. Karrie looked a bit envious considering what had just transpired.

“Oh, yeah?” Gale asked. “And then what did you do?”

“What did I do? Well I ran of course”

His wife let out another sigh. “I don’t understand why you are telling other people about your cowardice…”

“Nonsense\! It’s not cowardice, it's called being smart. Think”, he tapped his head with a finger, “how am I supposed to beat up a ghost? I don't know how to use magic\!” He looked proud as he pointed his nose in the air.

“Speaking of, what happened to that job of yours?”

“Dont even mention it.” He leant back into his chair crossing his arms. “They suddenly cancelled it, saying some nonsense about how we weren’t the right fit”

“Hah, if you’re not the right fit then I wonder who is?”

“I know right? Although this isn’t the first time this happened lately.” Gale threw his hand in the air. “What must one do to get a decent paying job…”

Victoria fed me one of the bits of food on the table. “I’m just glad nothing dangerous happened”. The two others just stared absentmindedly in the air.

“It did sound suspicious." Karrie’s mother remarked. “I tell you, all men think they are invincible.”  

“It adds to their charm don’t you think?” She covered her mouth as she gave out a small laugh. 

“It’s a wonder how you two are still in your honeymoon phase…” She glanced at her husband. He just shrugged.

Karrie’s father thought for a moment. “Maybe they got scared off by the Executioner?” Hearing the moniker, Eric and Karrie jumped a little.

“What a horrid nickname, they still haven’t catched them?” Gale replied.

“Well, you know how our lord baron does things here” He pointed his chin towards where the baron’s manor stood. 

Clicking his tongue, Gale chugged down the rest of his cup. “They always prioritise the wrong things. What happened to noblesse oblige?”

“That nobles had the duty to protect the peoples? Ha, you really believe in that nonsense?”

The four adults continued to chat with each other until it was time to head home. Eric promised to do something actually fun next time and apologized to Karrie and I. To which Karrie gave him a smack on his back, telling him it was fine. 

I didn’t mind, I had better things to think about. 

Tonight. Tonight? *Tonight.*

# Chapter 7: Finn

Hearing something plink at his window, Finn woke up after the third time it happened. With heavyset feet, he shuffled to the window, opening it. He thought it was one of the boys always hanging out with him. Instead, under his window stood someone unexpected. It was Esther. Her golden hair glistened in the moonlight. She was about to throw another pebble until she noticed him.

“Ah, there you are." She said cheerfully.

“Esther? What are you doing here?” It was in the middle of the night.

“Come down, I want to talk with you”

“Right now?” Finn was about to refuse, hadn’t it been Esther who asked. “Give me a second”

What did she want to talk about? Did she change her mind? That must be it. His heart rate rose a bit higher. With a light gait, he left his room, listed down the stairs; careful not to wake up his dad, and finally arrived at the front door. 

He grabbed the door handle. As the mechanism in the door began to operate, clicking sounds reverberated across the entrance. The silhouette was standing there in the door gap. Esther was already in front of the door, waiting, smiling. 

Finn couldn’t help but let out a yelp as she had been closer than he thought. 

“Did I scare you?” Her blue crescent moon shaped eyes sparkled in the darkness.

“Not really…”

“Come follow me\!” The words flowing from her soft lips felt almost enchanting. 

Finn followed after the girl. “Where are we going?” 

“Just a bit further?” She said without turning.

“What do you mean?” They had walked quite the distance. “What did you want to talk about?” Wasn’t the boy supposed to be the one asking the girl out?

She finally stopped. They were standing in the middle of the forest.

Finn had often played in this very forest, sometimes even camping outside with his dad. They had liked this place since it was so quiet. Esther glanced around.

“This looks like a good spot”

“A spot for what?” He felt his heart thumping, almost wanting to jump out of his chest. Was this actually going to happen?

“I have a confession I want to make.” She hid her hands behind her back. 

Oh, my goddess. Calm down. His palms were sweaty, his knees felt heavy. Play it cool, Finn.

“W-what is it?” Damn it, his voice cracked.

“I think you already know.” She smiled shyly. “Close your eyes for me?”

Done, eyes closed. He could hear her soft footsteps inch closer and closer. 

“You know Finn…” She trailed the last sound of his name. “I really. Really, really. Hate people like you\!” A sudden sharp feeling poked at his throat, throwing him over backwards. Opening his eyes in shock, Esther was standing there. The dagger she held glinted in the moonlight.

What? Why didn’t it pierce his neck?

“Huh?” The boy on the ground said stupidly. “Did you just stab me?” He was touching the spot where I had thrusted. Good observation idiot.

“Stay away\!” He scrambled to his feet to get away from me. He hit the ground again as he tripped over his own legs, planting his face into the dirt. Pathetic. 

This wasn’t the time to observe. With light feet, I bounced over to where he laid. He had turned over like a turtle legs sprawling out towards me. “What are you doing\!” He began crawling backwards on his back. Eventually hitting one of the many trees in the dim forest. 

I looked down at him, standing in between his legs. I raised my dagger again. I probably just missed last time. I still didn’t move this body that smoothly. 

Standing in between his legs, I looked down at him. He was like an insect, a worm, squirming around. I better make him stay still. The last attack was probably just a miss. I wasn’t hundred percent familiar with this body yet. Lifting my dagger in the air the moonlight seemed to envelop it, making it shine like silver. 

“Stop\!”

I slammed down my dagger.

“Aaa\!”

I heard the scream but the soft flesh of a person was nowhere to be felt. My dagger had bounced off. 

I stabbed again

It bounced off again. A yellow circle sparkled under the tip of my dagger.

What was happening?

Finn looked at me with a shocked expression before finally realizing the size difference. I could see the horizon flip over as I saw a leg land squarely into my gut. The knife flew across my vision, shining like a star.

Groaning, I tried to gather air back into my lungs. It hurt. I spat out the dirt in my mouth, what happened to the plan?

“You’re crazy\!” He stood up. “You’ve gone insane\!”

Don’t say that. I am not insane. 

“What do I do, what do I do?”

I tried to move my body, but it just hurt so much. 

“Dad, I have to wake up dad\!”

Feeling the dirt underneath my hands, I tried pushing myself off the ground. I need to run. I was good at running. I just need to run for today.

“You did this to yourself\!”

Something approached and slammed into my head. My mind went blank.

\*\*\*

“Wake up sleepyhead, class’ done already.” 

Where am I? A girl was sitting on my desk as she checked her phone.

“Hellooo? Earth to \*\*\*” A hand appeared in front of me, waving back and forth. 

“Karrie?” What’s she doing here?

“Karrie? Who’s that? I’m Ann, stupid. Your one and only friend. Did you have a silly dream or something?”

I glanced around, it was my old classroom. There were some formulas written on the blackboard, but it seemed like greek to me, literally. 

I glanced at Ann, she was wearing our school uniform.

“Whats the date?”

“Wow, gross... Did you read too many stupid books again? Here check it out”

Turning her phone toward me, I saw the date. It was 20XX.

“That can’t be…”

I could hear the bustling noises of people walking outside our classroom.

“What do you mean?” Ann placed a pencil on the tip of her nose, balancing it.

“I killed you, you are supposed to be dead.” The pencil snapped in half, each half making a sound as it hit my desk.

“Oh, right”

The scene shattered, everything disappearing. 

Ann was currently laying in a casket. Countless people had gathered together, all wearing black. I couldn’t recognize them, they were all wearing funeral veils. I couldn’t see their faces. The sounds of crying could be heard all over, It was maddening. 

“Is this better?”

Plastered all around were huge flower crests. The fragrant smell coming out of them made me sick. I felt my sweat trickle down my back, I felt the arms of them grabbing onto me. I felt the urge to run out of the funeral hall. I needed to puke.

Standing atop her own casket, Ann stared down at me. 

“Tell me.”

A pair of brown eyes pierced my own. I averted my gaze. I didn’t want to look at her.

“Did you really have to kill me?”

She was smiling in the corner of my eye.

\*\*\*

“You did well my son. Just go back to sleep. Your dad will sort out this misunderstanding."

I couldn’t see.

“It wasn’t a misunderstanding\! She tried to kill me\! Look\!”

My head ached.

“I understand, just go back to your room.”

“But Dad\!”

My hands were tied.

“I won’t say it twice”

He paused. “What are you going to do”

My legs were tied.

“Go to your room”

The sound of footsteps getting farther and farther away. A door opened and slammed shut.

“I know you are awake, kid.”

“Where am I”

“Somewhere secret.” He answered. “Oh I almost forgot”

The thing covering my eyes disappeared. A singular lamp lit up the room. There were a bunch of tools hanging on the wall. This place looked to be some carpenter’s workshop.

“You’re surprisingly calm for being tied up.” The middle aged man harrumphed. He looked like an older version of Finn.

“What do you want?” I glared at him.

“Straight to the point I see.” The corners of his mouth reached his eyes.

I tried to break free from my bondage.

“Ah, ah ah\!” He sang, wagging his finger at me. “Don’t waste your energy, no one has broken free before\!” He seemed proud.

“Does your son know about your disgusting hobby?” There had to be a way out of here

“Oh he knows. But you are mistaken.” He grabbed my head. “It's not disgusting”  
   
“What? Chopping off their heads is not disgusting?” There was a familiar sickly sweet fragrance in the air mixed in with the dust.

“They deserved it.” he stated matter-of-factly.

“I see”, the rope was digging into my wrists, “you’re just insane.”

“Me? Insane? You tried to kill my son\!” His face looked like a demon. “You are the insane one here\!” Some spittle from his mouth landed on my cheek.

“What did he do to you\!”

“It’s personal”

“Hah\! Is that right? Personal.” He picked up a hammer.

“Then would it be personal if I paid your mother a visit? What was her name again, Victoria?” He licked his smiling lips. Then it went back to being a demon.

“That damn vixen\! Always flaunting herself everywhere she goes\! Who does she think she is\!” The hammer moved erratically around, casting shadows in the room.

He calmed himself. “That’s right, I can just pay her a visit. A personal one.” 

“Don’t…” I mumbled.

He took a step closer. “What was that?”

“Don’t…” He turned his ear toward me, getting closer. “Don’t you dare touch her\!” I slammed into his head with my own, falling over in the process, chair and all.

“You touch her and I will kill-”

I felt the tip of his shoe digging into my gut. “You demon brat\!”

I spat out blood.

“That does it, after I’m finished with you.” He yanked my hair “Your pretty little mother is next.”

He set me back up. I had to get out of here, Victoria was in danger. I have to at least tell Gale. Think, there had to be a way out-

He lifted the hammer above my hands.

“Wait”

The hammer ascended higher. He was grinning.

“Wait, stop\!”

# Chapter 8: Why

“Honey, wake up”

“Hmm?” I felt my body shaking.

“Gale get up”

“What is it?” Five more minutes…

Smack\! My face got slapped.

“Galen Nikodemus\!”

“Wh-what is it?” 

“I can’t find Esther\!” Victoria seemed about to cry.

“What do you mean, isn’t she in bed?”

“She isn't\!" She was panicking.

I leapt out of bed, running to my daughters room. It was empty.

“Esther\!” Victoria began running around, throwing open the other doors, checking the rooms.

I called out to her. “Victoria”

“Esther\! Please come out\!”

“Victoria\!” I shook her by the shoulders, making her face me.

“She’s not here”

“What do you mean?” She stared blankly.

“I can’t sense her with my mana”

Victoria went quiet. She steeled her face.

“Can you find her?”

“Don’t worry” I began packing up my gear. “I will find her no matter what”

After ensuring that our vicinity was safe, I led Victoria to our neighbor, explaining to them the situation. Although shocked at first, they ushered my wife inside.

I closed my eyes and began focusing my mana into my eyes. I didn’t like to use this wretched technique but the situation called for it. Opening my eyes, the world lit up. The faint glow of countless colored lights filled my view. I focused on the golden lights, the color of my daughter. The glowing footsteps were pointing towards the town. Esther, where did you go in the middle of the night? 

I began sprinting, the moon at my back.

\*\*\*  
“Stop\!” It hurt.

“Stop it\!” It really hurt.

“Why should I?” The man stared at me. “You tried killing my son\!”

“Ahhh\!” The hammer crushed another one of my fingers.

“No one touches my son without my permission\!”

Why, why why why.

“Shhhh, don’t cry little girl.” He put his hand on my head. “You deserve this”. Pat, pat. 

I deserve this?

“You know that right?”

“Huh?”

“Tsk, you still don’t get it.” He raised his hammer again.

I don’t get it, do I really deserve this? Why do I deserve this? I just wanted to have a normal life. 

My shriek filled the room as my middle finger got crushed.

The hammer clattered to the floor. “That should be enough.” 

He went to the wall. *I want to see Victoria.* He picked up a knife. *I want to taste her cooking again.* He took a step closer. *I want her to give me a hug again.*

“Mom…” I really don’t want to die.

“Don’t you worry”, he raised his knife, “you will be able to meet her soon”

I’m sorry mom. I can’t stop crying. I promise I will stop. Please forgive me.

The knife flew towards my neck stabbing into it. I felt nothing. 

A thud sounded from below my tied legs. Wrenching open my teary eyes, I saw the knife laying there, the hand still gripping it.

“You bastard\!”

He flew across the room into the wall. Gale was standing there sword in hand. My dad had arrived.

“You dare touch my daughter\!” The blade flew through the air, slicing off another hand. It didn’t even leave a shadow.

He let out a pained roar. “My hands\!”

“Shut your mouth\!” His head flew backwards, a few teeth hit the ground.

“S-shtop\!”

Dad slashed with his sword. The left leg got severed.

“W-wait\!”

Another slash, another leg.

“You bastard\! Do you know who I-”

“You goddamn demon\!”

The blade sliced through the air, through his neck, sending his head flying. Rolling on the bloodied floor, his eyes were still open in shock.

“Esther\!” He turned toward me. Blood had spattered all over his clothes and face.

“Oh my goddess, let me get you out of here.” He began untying my hands and legs.

“Dad…”

“It’s okay, I’m here, It’s okay.”

“It hurts…”

“You’re fine, don’t you worry”. He picked me up into his arms.

“I thought I was going to die…”

“You’re not going to die, I’m here.”

“I don’t want to die\!” I cried into his arms.

The incident threw the whole town into chaos. The captain of the guards had died, his body displayed in the middle of town square for all to see. The townspeople started protesting, demanding the capture of the Executioner. The Baron had to listen to the people, lest be trampled under their angry mob. Resultingly, a bunch of guards from the surrounding towns and cities got sent here. 

My dad had investigated the secret area and found a field of growing flowers, white lilies were blooming in the dark underground. I had been caught by that very same serial killer. The guards concluded the town-wide search and concluded that he had fled the town after seeing the number of guards. The angry townspeople reluctantly accepted this, and the following incident-free days seemed to reassure them. The town was in a joyous mood.

Finn had disappeared somewhere, but I couldn’t care less. Karrie and Eric had a hypothesis that he also got taken by the Executioner, which I couldn’t help but find funny.

And so a month had passed. The leaves were turning brown and thin summer dresses changed into jackets and coats. My fingers on my left hand could still not fully bend and scars marred my skin where the hammer had hit. 

My mom had calmed down considerably, now only hovering around me occasionally. A sad expression crept onto her face each time she saw my hands, making me want to start wearing gloves. Hearing this she only got sadder, but she still made me a thin pair.

Sitting with my hands clasped in my lap, I glared at the statue towering over me. What’s so funny? The marble face smirked at me. I felt my anger rising. 

We were visiting the church today. Dad had asked, or demanded, that the head priest use his healing magic on me. He had a more sizable amount of divine mana and could therefore use a higher grade healing spell. The always smiling priest had frowned for a moment as my body rejected the spell. He remarked how he now knew how the other priest felt.

The sun streamed through the stained glass, blinding me in the eyes. Why was I reincarnated? Was this even a reincarnation? I took over someone’s body and still had my old memories. The monks at the temple said that life was like a wheel, neither a start nor an end existed. Is that why I have my memories? Nothing made sense. Frustration began building up.

I felt my face twist. And why did my knife just bounce off of that kid’s neck? The plan was perfect, there were no holes. If the golden circles hadn’t stopped me from piercing my dagger through his neck, then he wouldn’t have had the chance to retaliate. He should have had his jugular cut, resulting in him bleeding out within three minutes. I touched my stomach, it was still stinging a bit.

“Is this your doing?” My voice echoed in the empty prayer room. Silence.

“Why did you send me here?” The goddess just looked at me, smugly.

“What am I supposed to do\!” I stood up.

“I don’t understand.” I said.

“I don’t understand\!” 

The sun stood behind the statue, making a halo out of its uncaringly shining rays.

“Don’t you look at me like that, wipe that goddamn smile off your face\!”

Her gaze pressed me down to my knees. The smell irritated my nose.

“Say something… anything…”

“I didn’t ask to be reincarnated…” My fists fell to the floor..

“I can’t even kill anyone in this life\!” Thumps sounded from the carpeted floor.

“I can’t do this…” Tears rolled down from my face, staining the blood-red carpet. “Tell me what to do…”

“Esther\!” Victoria ran over to me, finding me splayed out in front of the statue.

“What’s wrong?” She hugged me there on the floor.

I pressed my face into her arms. “Mom…” 

“What is it sweetie? It’s okay, just tell me”

“I want to go home…”

“Of course, we will go home right away.” Her fingers ran through my hair. 

“My sweet little Esther”

\*\*\*  
Today was my birthday, or more correctly, it was Esther’s birthday. Sugar was hard to come by so the small cake in front of me was a bit surprising. Mom had splurged a bit with some help from our neighbor, Karrie's family, and baked a cake. It was a simple thing but it tickled my heart nonetheless.

Invited to my first ever birthday party and Esther's fourteenth party were: my parents, Karrie’s parents, Karrie, and Eric. We had gotten much closer these past months. The cold had seeped in and the naked trees were covered in fluffy white snow. It had begun to melt today.

“Congratulations Esther\! May the goddess watch over you\!” Karrie said enthusiastically. Yeah, no thanks.

“What are you gonna wish for?” Eric asked.

Dad answered instead of me. “Of course she will ask for money\!” 

“What are you saying?” Karrie’s dad asked. “A growing girl only has one thing to wish for, gems\!”

“Oh, you’re right”

Karrie’s mom let out a sigh. “You two…”  

“What are you going to wish for?” My mom asked. 

My wish? I’ve never wished for something before. I felt my eyebrows scrunch together. I glanced through the room. Dad and Karrie’s dad were busy arguing on what a girl wanted to wish for. The sighs got louder the more they argued. Karrie and Erik were busy not trying to puke their dinner out. And my mom, with her pretty blue eyes, was busy looking at me. The whole room smelled of cake. It’s sweet smell made me smile a little. I only had one wish on my mind right now.

“My wish…” The room went quiet.

The corners on my mouth turned it into a big smile. The air, warmed by the warmth of the people present, was refreshing as it enveloped my teeth. “My wish is to always have happy days like this\!” 

I picked up the knife using my right hand and cut into the cake. Applause painting the background as I prepared a slice. 

“Excuse me”. Someone had knocked on the door. “Let me go check who it is.” My dad said.

“Raviel? What are you doing here?” It was the lady with the bow that had hired him. She didn’t have the bow with her today.

“I have come here today as a messenger”

“A messenger?” My dad grasped the letter handed to him.

“I shall take my leave then.” She grabbed the side of her skirt, threw a leg back, and bent her knees. It was a perfect curtsy. “My lord” 

By the time I blinked, dad had already grabbed her by the neck, lifting her off the floor with one hand.

“Who sent you?” His murderous aura filled the room, pressing us into silence. 

Raviel didn’t seem distressed in the least.

“Your father.” She uttered.

# Chapter 9: New City

The steam coming from the cup of tea placed in front of me, flew gently toward the ceiling, eventually disappearing like a dream. Thrown on the dinner table was the letter Raviel had gifted my dad. The pure white piece of paper was crumpled, several creases were visible. Were you to follow those creases like a piece of origami, I would believe it would make a wonderful ball of paper. I glanced at my parents sitting at the table.

My mom clenched her cup of tea

My mom gripped her cup of tea, stroking the handle with her thumb. “Do you know why you were called back?” 

“How should I know what my father is thinking?” My dad spat out. My mom’s shoulders shrank into herself, making her silhouette smaller. My hands palmed into themselves as I averted my gaze to my cup. This scene was too familiar. My body began to prickle. 

He sighed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to say it like that”, he said as he covered my mom’s hands. “It’s just…” He paused. “I really don't know.”

“How did they even find us?” Her hands were turning white as they wrapped around the cup. “Why now?” Glistening beads began to form in the corner of her eyes. Her body began to tremble. 

My dad stood up and wrapped her into his arms. He said nothing as he stood there, letting his wife crease up his ironed shirt. Wet stains formed where my mother’s face dug into his messed up shirt. I felt my body heat flush.

I went outside.

Taking in the cool winter air, my breath formed a little cloud as I exhaled. I thought happy days would follow me after my birthday party, however the nailing pain in my fingers drove my mind back to reality. The letter was like a curse, bringing with it misfortune. I hadn’t slept well, I hadn’t eaten well, and dad had gotten later and later home. My mom always hugged me, but it didn’t feel the same. A veil of some sort had been placed above us.

I bent my damaged finger. It sent a signal to my brain making me frown. My parents had come to a consensus when I placed myself back into the house. We were to leave this town in a week.

\*\*\*

“I still can’t believe it…” Karrie’s dad said. “Who would’ve thunk you were a noble?”

We were currently loading our possessions into a horse-drawn wagon outside our house. My dad had made quick work stacking the boxes making only a few remain. 

“Well, you never asked.” He patted his friend on the shoulder as the last box, which my books were, was getting loaded in the cloth-roofed canopy. 

“As for me”, Karrie’s mom said, “I always knew something was different about you.” She looked him up and down. “An aura of sorts?”

“Hey, what's with your leering look, woman.” Her husband shot back. “Don’t you look at my friend like that\!” He went in front of my dad, shielding him from his wife.

“Get out of the way\! Don’t touch him with your filthy commoner hands\!”

The two of them had been considerably shocked when they found out my dad’s surname for the first time. Yet, like the speed of questions thrown toward my parents, they went just as fast back to acting like usual. They bantered back and forth as the finalizations were done. 

“My dear Victoria\!” She held my mom’s hands. “I can’t believe you are leaving me all alone in this town…”

“What are you saying? You still have your husband.” She smiled prettily.

Karrie’s mom clicked her tongue and feigned a faint, putting the back of her hand on her forehead. “I don’t think I can do it…” 

My mom let out a laugh. “I promise I will send you a bunch of letters.”

“You better hold onto that promise\!” She said, giving her an enormous hug. 

“I don’t think I can do that…” Karrie had watched our moms. 

“Why not? I like hugs”

She blushed. “It’s embarrassing.”

This would probably be the last time that I saw Karrie. The distance from here to our destination was considerable, even when that shortened with the help of magic teleporting gates. I didn’t even get surprised when I first heard about them, I thought to myself, surprised. 

I had gotten familiar with essentially seeing her everyday. We would chat together, take strolls together, collect insects together, and find ourselves occasionally making trouble. It reminded me of that short period of time in my past. I pressed back the tingling feeling creeping up my nose.

I gave her a hug. “Take care, Karrie.” 

“You too, Esther\!” 

Standing there surrounded by the melting snow, our smiles seemed to warm our bodies.

Their waving arms had disappeared with the horizon as I sat back down in the rocking wagon. My body was getting jostled side to side by the wooden wheels grinding through the cold-hardened dirt. I didn’t know I was prone to getting car-, wagon sick. 

I managed to eek out a question on how further we had to drive. My father simply smiled at me splayed onto my mother’s lap. We hadn’t even started, he said. I felt myself despair as my mother combed through my hair.

The empire had an extensive network of magic gates connecting various cities together, making it easy for people to move around the vast land of the empire. As one might suspect, it cost a considerable sum to use one of these gates. As a result, only higher ranked nobles or merchants with vast fortunes were the ones benefiting from them. In the letter, demanding my dads return, was an eight-sided token. This allowed us to use the magic gate for free but only once. Duke Nikodemus must have wanted his son to visit as fast as possible. Thinking about it, wouldn’t that make him my grandfather?

“Don’t get your hopes up, Esther. He isn’t the type of person to be playing house.”

“What about my grandmother?” My dad smiled. 

My mom answered my question. “She’s a wonderful woman.” She mirrored her husband's expression. “Did you know she saved my life once?” 

I couldn’t help but wonder how such contrasting reactions could come from the mention of my grandparents. I wonder how such a mismatched couple could even conceive a person like my dad. My grandmother must be a really grand woman. 

My parents chatted together as we traveled to the neighboring city where a gate was available. And finally, after a whole day of suffering on the seats of the wagon, we arrived at the entrance to the city.

“This looks good enough.” My dad opened the door to the room we had rented for the day. The magic gate required a half day's worth of time to check our cargo and clear it for transport. Not wanting to arrive earlier than required, my dad suggested resting in this city for a day. I welcomed that thought.

I threw myself on the bed. It smelled a little funny, but I couldn’t care less right now. My eyes were still spinning even when I closed my eyes. 

I threw myself onto the bed, digging my face into the pillow. It smelt of lavender. They just had to use flowers. My eyes span around behind my eyelids like ballet dancers as I tried to hold in the rising feel of my stomach.

“Oh, my poor daughter…” I felt my mothers touch as she patted my back. 

“I don’t want to ride the wagon anymore…”

My dad shattered that hope. “Sorry to say this, but we are still only halfway.”

“Mom…”

“Just rest for now, sweetie. We can go eat some delicious food\!” I heard her say cheerfully.

*I didn’t want to eat anything*, was what I had previously thought as I stood there in the bakery. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the store, not letting a single visitor escape unscathed. Displayed by the counter stood countless types of pastries, ranging from simple wheat rolls to elegantly designed cakes in all types of colors. It looked just like one of those cafes I had seen in my previous life. 

I shook my pocketbook and heard some coins clink together, ringing out like bells. My allowance for the day was a whole three silver coins. Add to that my first ever silver coin, it totaled to a considerable sum. The first silver coin I had gotten was still with me, accompanying me whenever I went out. I had originally wanted to spend it on something or the other but each time my plotting failed. The only explanation was that it was enchanted by magic. I considered it a lucky charm of some sorts.

“How much for a slice of that cake?” I pointed to something plain-looking.

“That’ll be five silvers.” The barista-looking woman answered.

I had to pick up my fallen jaw. My dad had said that five silver should be enough to buy enough interesting souvenirs and still have enough for food and snacks. Why, our room cost us only three silvers for the day.

I pointed to a bag of cookies. “What about that?”

“That’ll be two silvers.” I felt something stab into my heart.

Pointing to a stupid looking bread roll I asked. “What about-”

“That’ll be three coppers.” The woman was smiling at me.

Standing outside the bakery I bit into my bread roll. It tasted like bread. Disappointed, I sat down on a nearby bench and watched as the people and carriages passed by. It was one of my new hobbies.

The busy city road was double the width of those in our town and the amount of people busily strutting to and fro must have been four times as many. The sound of the carriage wheels sent shivers down my spine as it rolled along the muddy road.

The pure white color of snow I had gotten used to seeing the past few months was nowhere to be seen. Replacing it was the color brown. Brown roads, brown horses and brown three-coppers costing bread. Something red broke up the monotony as it approached me.

“Eshter?” The red hair called out to me.

“What are you doing here?”

I observed the boy that had left town two weeks ago. He was learning the trade of his family and went around nearby towns and cities seeking profit from his wares. He had grown considerably since the first time I saw him. His face had lost some of its boyness and his shoulders looked to be sturdier. He smirked at me.

“Did you get lost again?”

I considered throwing the half eaten piece of bread at his stupid face.

# Chapter 10: Eric

I put the rest of the bread roll into my pocketbook. “I’m not lost.”

“That so?” He plopped down beside me. My golden hair fluttered in the air as I bounced off the bench. The wooden planks were bending a bit.

“What are you looking at?” We sat staring in the same direction looking at the other people walking by. 

“Are you here with your mom?” I didn’t see her with him.

“Yeah, we got some extra seeds from TKanothercityname.” He pulled out a round black seed the size of my fingertip. Its outer shell felt rough as it laid limply on my palm, making a scratching sound when I poked it.

“I don’t get why no one buys them.” He pulled out another one and popped it into his mouth, crunching it between his teeth. I could see a few bits of the outer shell fall out of his mouth. It looked and sounded just like eating eggshells. 

“They don’t taste that bad.” He looked serious saying that. 

“What plant is this?”

“Dunno.”

“And you just ate it?” Incredible.

“I was hungry, okay?” He seemed almost offended. “I know what you just thought.”

“You’re imagining things.” 

I kicked my legs as we continued to people-watch. A man and woman were walking with their arms linked together. I wonder what my parents are doing right now.

“I’m bored. Let’s go do something.”

“Do what?”

“No idea, there must be something to do in this city.” He shook his bag of seeds. “Maybe I can find someone to buy these things.” He explained how his mother had assigned him to find someone willing to buy these off their hands. He popped another one into his mouth. 

“You know you are supposed to plant them right?” I remarked.

I glanced through the shop windows while strolling around with Eric. Whenever something weird or strange caught my eyes he would give me a quick and concise answer. His explanations seemed to make it seem more interesting than they really were. A set of ceramic cups could be seen through the window. They were apparently the local product of this city. The cups’ color was unique only to this region as it required a type of clay that could only be harvested around here. They just looked like green tea cups to me.

Eric would give me a long explanation each time I pointed to an object. He seemed to take his apprenticeship seriously as he knew a little about everything. I wondered how much he had studied these past days. I started pointing at whatever caught my eyes.

“Esther”, he looked thirsty, “I think you already know about all these things.”

“I don’t remember what they are.” I stood in front of a display where wares of different colors and shapes were being shaded by the stall. The vendor was busy haggling with the other customers, paying the two of us no mind. 

“You know that you can’t use that line anymore right?”  

“Eric, I really don’t remember, please.” I pointed to an orange object, feeling my mouth twitch as I begged him.

“At least try not to smile while saying that…” He sighed. “These are called carrots, a staple food in our kingdom.”

“Is that so? What about these yellow things?”

“Those are potatoes”

“And these?”

“Onions.”

“Your explanations are quite short, Eric. No one would buy anything from you with that attitude. You make a lousy merchant.”

He gave me a big professional smile. “Thanks, Esther. I will take that advice to heart.”

TK add inn female lead having some trouble

I skipped around the different shops and stalls all the while dragging along Eric. His shoulders slumped as he dragged his feet after me. That’s weird. I thought he was bored? The roads came to an end, opening up to a square with a clocktower standing in the middle. And below that a crowd had formed. 

The gaggle of people formed a circle while they applauded and sent ou

The gaggle of people was centered around something. Applause and excited voices could be heard ringing as I tried to get a glimpse of whatever that had them this excited. Standing between two adults, I glanced under their armpits.

Mint green hair reminiscent of the tea cups I had seen blew gently in the air. It looked almost to turn blue against the backdrop of the sky. A pair of soft round eyes, the color of fresh summer leaves, looked flustered as she held the hands of an old woman kneeling before her. She looked like a doe clad in pastel garments as she tried to help the elderly woman off the dirty ground. 

A young man stood behind her, diagonal to the side, with his hands behind his back. He had an impassioned look standing guard behind her, the scabbard hanging on his hip indicating his work.

“Ah, please don’t do this\! Your clothes will get dirty.”

“My clothes getting dirty is nothing in comparison to what you have done for me. I must show you my gratitude\!”

“P-please get up, I didn’t help you to get your gratitude\!” She babbled.

“A simple thanks is enough for me.” An angelic smile formed on the young girl’s face, she looked just like how my mom often looked at me. I could feel the affection flowing from her gaze standing all the way over here.

The old woman broke into tears as she looked up at her.

“Ah, please don’t cry\!” She looked flustered again.

A voice called from the crowd. “She did it again\!”

“I can’t believe she used healing magic on her.”

“She did it for free too.”

“Did it work? I’ve never seen such a bright light before.”

The old woman finally stood up holding a cane in her hand. But the tip didn’t touch the ground, she held it with both her hands. 

Someone in the crowd exclaimed. “I can’t believe it\!”

“Who is she?”

“She’s a goddess\!”

Resounding cheers filled the area we had been gathering in. The old woman lifted her wooden cane high above her head, stretching it into the sky. The stick grabbed our attention as it went higher and higher. I could feel the guard putting his hand above the hilt of his sword, until we all saw it flying downwards at an amazing speed before stopping upon impacting her bent knee. It broke cleanly in half. Silence filled the air.

My mouth went wide as I tried to register in my head what had just happened. The girl seemed to be in the same vein as me standing there cupping her mouth. The young man standing a step behind her simply let out a sigh of relief before turning back into an impassioned statue. The silence broke when the old woman roared. 

“That felt good\!”

The crowd joined her roar and I could hear Eric beside yelling something or the other. 

I saw for the first time how healing magic was supposed to look like as she healed some other people from the crowd. A yellow magic circle formed from her palmed out hands as she focused her breathing. A few seconds later the person being injected let out a really blinding flash of light. It must have felt good as all of them had exclaimed their relief. 

The girl continued to treat the crowd, healing whatever illness or ailment had plagued them. She didn’t seem troubled at all, apart from the people kneeling down in gratitude, as she went through all of them. She simply gave them a gentle smile as her hair shook with the wind.

The crowd had long dispersed and only the two of them remained, she sat on a bench while he watched over her. They were saying something to each other but stopped when they noticed us walking over to them. 

“Oh\!” She clapped her hands. “I saw you two watching from the crowd earlier.” Seeing her up front she looked to be the same age as me, maybe a bit older.

“I’m afraid we are currently taking a break.” The young man said.

“Don’t be like that Leon, I’m really fine.” He simply grunted in reply.

“I’m Esther, I’m currently visiting this city. Oh, and I’m fourteen.” I said my perfect introductory line. The man furrowing his eyebrows didn’t bother me at all. 

“She’s still using that introduction?” I could hear Eric mutter regretfully behind me before also introducing himself. It was different from how I said it but it should do. 

The girl let out a chuckle, her sweet voice tickled my ears a bit. “My name is Lavenza, I’m currently traveling with this grumpy boy to see the world.” She gestured to the adult-looking boy. “And I’m sixteen”. Her pure white teeth blinded my eyes as she smiled, making me almost shield my eyes. She must have been a noble as I stared at her elegant sense of air.

“Did you want to ask me something, Esther?”

“Have you traveled to a lot of places?” I asked.

“Oh, more than I can count.”

“Have you seen this seed before?” I decided to help out Eric with his appointment.

She held it in her hand giving it a look. “What seed is this?”

“We don’t know.” Eric answered for me.

“You don’t know?” Leon’s eyes narrowed.

“Yeah, but it’s tasty.” Eric demonstrated for us, crunching the seed shell and all.

“A tasty seed?” Lavenza glanced down at the seed in her fingers.

The boy sighed. “Give it.” He put the round seed he got from her. A crunching sound reverberated in his mouth.

“How is it?” Eric said expectantly. 

“It tastes like raisins.” 

“I know right?\! No one seemed to want to try them. Here, I have lots more\!” He pulled out his bag of seeds.

“I could do without the shell though.” 

Lavenza took another seed from the ecstatic Eric. 

“Oh wow\! It really does taste like raisins.” 

“Esther, now you really have to try one.”

“No thanks, you have some bits stuck in your teeth by the way.”

Eric began poking at his teeth as I told him where to put his finger.

“Ha ha\! You two really make a funny pair.”

“Really?” I couldn’t see the connection.

“Oh I know\!” She said, “Let’s be friends\!”

And so Lavenza and I became friends with the healing girl and her taciturn guard. We chatted while I sat with her while the two boys stood. They seemed to surprisingly vibe well together as Leon began showing off his sword. 

“Lavenza, you seem like a powerful healer.” I asked her. 

“I don’t think I’m that impressive.” She stared in front of her. “I just try my best.”

“Has your healing not worked before?” 

“It hasn't. Why are you asking?” 

I pulled off the glove on my left hand letting it feel the cool air for the first time in a while. Her mouth opened a little and I could see Leon twitch his forehead a little standing there with Eric, he didn’t react. 

It was expected as the flesh squirming around my once-crushed fingers were bulging like waves with circles in its epicenter. My marred hand really looked disgusting as I tried fully bending my fingers. It felt like nails stabbing into it when my bend reached its full potential. I wanted to fix my hand, if not for my mom’s sake. I could still remember how she looked when she saw my disfigured hand for the first time.

“Do you think you can heal my hand? I have three silvers if you want.” It was beyond low for employing a priest or a mage who could heal, still it was all I had right now.

“Don’t you worry Esther.” She held my hand. “I will try my best, no, I *will* do my best\! We’re friends\!”. 

She began focusing and a golden circle appeared over my left hand, the circle looked familiar. And after a while, nothing happened. No bright lights, no nothing. 

“Huh? What’s happening?” I didn’t really get my hopes up.

“Let me try again.” Nevertheless, I felt a bit disappointed as I saw the golden circle appear again. I already knew healing magic didn’t work this body.

“It’s fine, Lavenza.” I quickly put my glove back on. “I expected the outcome.”

“Esther, let me try once-”

“It’s fine.” I stood up from the bench.

“It was fun talking to you two, but it’s getting late, we better take our leave now.” The sun had begun dipping in the sky, making the towering clock tower cast a TKsizable shadow across the ground. 

“Esther, wait-”

“Let’s meet again should the opportunity rise.” I began walking.

Eric was apologizing or something before I heard his brisk footsteps come up behind me. I continued walking while he followed.

“Esther, are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“Where are we going?”

“I don’t know.”

“Can you wait for a moment?”

“...”

“Esther, please stop walking.” I felt something grab my hand.

“Let go\!” I yanked my arm back, facing him. It hurt.

“Please talk to me, Esther.” He had a stupid expression plastered on his face.

“What’s wrong?”

“I don’t know\!” I shot back at him. I didn’t know what part of my body that hurt.

“Let’s just calm down, okay?”

“Shut up\!”

I glared at him, glared at his red hair and glared at his TKcolor eyes. Don’t you look at me like that, Eric. 

He took a step toward me. “Breathe, Esther.”

“You’re an idiot\!”

“Yes, I’m an idiot, but you need to breathe, Esther.”

He took another step.

“You’re stupid\!”

“I’m the most stupid person you know, take a deep breath, Esther.”

He put his hand over my eyes, covering them. 

“Just breathe.”

I didn’t want to feel this way

“It hurts…” 

“I know.”

“I was really scared…”

“You’re safe now.”

I stood there while Eric continued to shield my eyes. He didn’t say anything as I felt myself calm down. We must have been standing there for a while.

“*Sniffle*.”

“Have you calmed down?” I could taste something salty sliding down my face as it fell into my mouth.

“*Hic*, Yeah…”

My body shook from the sudden hiccups.

“Can I move my hand now?”

“Not yet…”

It felt calming not being able to see anything.

“I was going to give this to you earlier but so much happened.” I could hear him take something out of his bag.

“I’m gonna move my hand now okay?”

I stayed silent as my eyes took in the bright light outside. A mass of yellow petals bloomed in front of my eyes.

“My mom said they represent strong bonds.”

Yellow alstroemerias.

“Did you get one from Karrie too?”

It smelled disgustingly sweet. I felt my mind go blank.

# Chapter 11: Lavenza

TK add flashback scene of either temple discussing suffering of life or he original mom doing something. 

“\*\*\*, you are probably wondering why the Buddha said life is suffering right?”

I was about to put the piece of tofu in my mouth. “No?”

“Well, let me tell you anyway.”

TK add in some dialogue discussing why life is suffering even when it doesn’t feel like that.

“Did you understand?”

I picked up a piece of sauteed mushroom. “Not really.”

\*\*\*  
I woke up laying in bed, did I pass out? Where’s Eric? I looked around and saw that it was the inn we had rented. My mom was sleeping on a chair by the bedside. I couldn’t help but think this scene was familiar. Once again, I had made my mom sleep in that uncomfortable position. Sorry.

She opened her eyes as I fumbled around on the bed. 

“Oh, are you okay?” She immediately began fretting over me, she took my temperature with the back of her hand. 

“Good, no fever.” She nodded to herself.

“Mom, I feel fine.”

“Sorry Esther, but I really don’t believe you right now.” She looked concerned. 

“Who knows what would have happened if Eric wasn’t with you? Do you know how shocking it was when we saw him carrying you?” She patted my head. 

“What happened?” 

“Where’s Eric?” I saw my gloves on the nightstand.

“He left saying he had to go with his mother.” I see. “They left yesterday to TKstartertown.

“Yesterday? What about the magic gate?” I needed to quickly get ready.

“Don’t you worry, we are extending our stay for another night.”

“I’m sorry…”

“Hush, you did nothing wrong.” She held me in her bosom. It felt nice.

“Can you tell me what happened? Eric didn’t say much.”

“What did he say?”

“Just that he was ‘sorry’, did he do something to you?”

“Do you really think Eric would do something?”

“He seems like a good boy.”

“He is.”

I told her what had happened yesterday. How I coincidentally met Eric, how we went around the city and found an interesting pair that we befriended. 

“... I don’t remember what happened afterwards.” I lied to her.

“Really?” She seemed surprised about something.

“What is it?”

“I can’t believe my sweet daughter is already experiencing love\!” She looked exceedingly happy.

“What do you mean?” Love?

“You went on a date with Eric through the city\!”

“It wasn’t a date…”

“Sure it was. It sounded lovely too.”

“Mom, it wasn’t like that.”

“Did you have fun?”

Did I have fun? I thought back on my memories. It had been fun until I, uh… got angry.

“Come here, there’s no need to be embarrassed.” She nuzzled against me.

“Should I tell your father?”

“Mom, it wasn't a date.”

Father had at first also looked concerned when he saw me laying in bed. But mom told him what happened yesterday and he got concerned for another reason. 

“That rascal…”

“Oh hush, he seems like a good boy.” 

“I need to talk with him when we get back.” I need to change the subject.

“What happened to the magic gate?”

“Oh right”, my dad remarked, “we are leaving tomorrow morning. So you just rest for today, I’m grounding you.

“What?” 

“Who knows what would have happened to you if that rascal weren’t with you? We can’t have you sleeping on some boy’s back again. I don’t think I can have that scene happen again…”

“Your father is just worried about your health, sweetie.” Mom said as he scratched his chin.

She pulled out a book. “I bought you a souvenir.” 

“TK The memoirs in the capital”, it was a story written like a diary detailing the most popular spots in the capital. 

“This looks expensive…”

“You are supposed to say thank you.” Dad said.

I smiled. “Thanks mom, I love it\!”

I had read halfway through the book when my mom entered the room. The morning sun was now at its apex.

“Esther, are you expecting guests?”

“I don’t think so?”

“They look like the people you described earlier.”

How did they find me? Luckily my pyjamas had been changed earlier making me look well dressed enough to stroll the streets. Mom had insisted that even when loafing in the room all day, one should still clothe themselves. 

Sitting at a table 

The inn doubled as both a place to sleep and to eat. On the second floor, guests could use the numerous rooms all lined up by the walls. And on the first floor, food could be ordered from the quaint diner. The innkeeper and his wife were the only two working the inn.

“What are you two doing here?” I asked the pair that sat at one of the tables. 

“Oh, what did I tell you, Leon? It was her mother.” Lavenza turned to the boy opposite her seat who just let out a small exhale.

“How did you know?” I could feel my mom peeking from the second floor as I took a seat, joining their table. Lavenza turned to her direction then back at me. 

“You too look exactly the same\!” She chirped happily. “Leon, look again\!”

“Lavenza, you are being rude again.”

“Oh.”

“So what are you two doing here, I don’t think I told you where I was staying at.”

“Eric told us to visit.”

She explained that after carrying me back, he had found the two of them strolling the markets telling them I got sick.

“Are you fine now? You left so abruptly yesterday…” Her eyes looked at the cup in her hands. “It’s my fault isn’t it?”

“What do you mean?”

“You looked fine before I tried to use healing magic. Did you feel unwell from that?”

In some sense it did, however the real reason was that my emotions had run rampant. I don’t really understand why I reacted that way, it just did. It didn’t feel good.

“I feel fine now.”

“I knew it. I can’t believe my powers could make someone sick. I’m so sorry, Esther...” She bowed her head.

Shivers went down my spine when I saw the two of them apologize, Leon also had also bent his head. This must be how Lavenza felt when seeing the kneeling people.

“You shouldn’t bow your head that easily”, I said. “Aren’t you a noble?”

Did they really need to look that dumbfounded? “How did you know?”

“It was obvious with your appearance”, I turned to Leon. “You even have a bodyguard protecting you.” 

Nobles never traveled alone, my dad had said. It was to flaunt to the commoners that they were worth more. My mother argued back that they had to travel in a group because there were many angry and dangerous people willing to do anything, especially to noblewomen. My mom looked uncharacteristically angry when she told him that, to which my dad had to reluctantly accept defeat.

Lavenza looked flustered and Leon just sighed.

“It hasn’t even been that long before I got caught…”

“Do I have to call you Lady Lavenza now?” It rolled off nicely off the tongue.

“Ah\! Don’t even think about it\! Just call me like you usually do.”

“Yes, my lady.” I couldn’t help but chuckle seeing her blushing face.

“You’re surprisingly nonchalant about this, Esther”, Leon said. “Commoners are typically afraid to talk to nobles.”

“The noble ruling our town happens to be a decent person. You can often spot him in town talking to the townspeople.”

“Really? That’s unusual…”, Lavenza added. 

“Oh, that’s right. My father is also a noble.” The two of them looked stunned. Nice I even managed to get Leon.

“Which makes me a noble too. I think.” 

Lavenza was about to open her mouth when the door to the inn creaked open. It was my dad.

“Are you out and walking about, Esther?” He walked up to our table. “You must be my daughter’s new friends, please take good care of her.” A handsome smile appeared in front of us. I didn’t really notice this but he was rather tall, standing half a head higher than even the tall Leon. His forearm muscles bulged, showing off well-defined veins as he held a bag. It looked heavy.

They turned to me, unsure what to say in this situation. I just put my finger in front of my mouth.

“A-ah, yes\! We will make sure to do that.” Her voice pitched weirdly.

“Of course”, Leon took a pause in his sentence, “sir.”

“Haha, you befriended some energetic kids again.” He patted my head. “Well, let me make myself scarce, you guys have fun.” The stairs creaked under the combined weight of my dad and his bag full of stuff. 

Silence filled the room where only the three of us used. The other guests had already started their day or were sleeping in. 

“What\!?” Lavenza exclaimed. “You’re a noble too?”

“My father is a noble. I found out about a week ago.”

“So the reason you are visiting the capital is…”

“Yup, we're going to visit my grandfather.”

“Sounds complicated…” Lavenza threw herself over the table. “It’s not easy being a noble. I just want to have fun and travel”, she babbled.

“Interesting”, Leon said, “Is Eric a noble too?”

“Not everyone from our town is secretly a noble, you know?”

“Funny hearing that from you.”

Lavenza pulled herself back up. “Do we have to call you Lady Esther now too?”

“That sounds nice, I would prefer that.”

“I would rather not…”

“You can call me whatever you want, Lady Lavenza.”

“Stop calling me that\!”

The two of them had initially wanted to just check up on me, however it had gotten pretty late when we finally found pause in our chatting. My mom suggested we eat together, she wanted to thank the guests for entertaining my day.

The diner was now filled up with dozens of people making the air in here a bit stifled but warm. It felt cozy in the late winter temperature. Mrs. Innkeeper was busily going to and fro deftly weaving between the tables and customers alike, in her hands dozens of dishes were stacked as she swooped up the empty plates and placed new ones in one motion. The steam coming from the dishes cooked by Mr. Innkeeper smelt delicious. 

“So you got grounded?” Lavenza asked while neatly spooning some steaming soup. Leon, sitting beside her, grabbed some bread with his hands and chomped on it, letting out a crispy crunching sound.

My mom told them that I was often feeling unwell and had to rest adequately. I had to spare some energy for the trip tomorrow.

“Wow, a magic gate. You should look forward to it, it's pretty amazing\!”

“You have used one before?” My dad asked.

“O-oh, I read about it in a book\!”

“A book huh? Did you learn to read at the church?”

“The church?”

“You have healing powers right?” Mom answered instead. “Thank you for using it on our daughter, I don't know how to repay you.”

“It was nothing\! Besides, it didn't work…”

“I see”, dad remarked. “She must have shown you two. Thank you for still accepting her.” My dad looked sad.

“She’s been a good friend to us”, Leon said, nodding his head.

“Ho ho, you two really are respectful. Are you perhaps-”

My mom smacked my fathers arm, sending him a silent stare before turning to them.

“You two must still be hungry, here have some more, doesn’t it taste better the more people there are?”

“It really does\!” Lavenza nodded enthusiastically.

With the plates wiped clean and ample time had passed, Lavenza and Leon took their leave. She promised to say hello the next time we met and gave me her handkerchief. It felt soft beneath my gloves and a crest was embroidered in the corner. I wondered what house she came from as I waved back at her shrinking image. Leon didn’t even look back once.

It was finally time as I checked my pocketbook. Money, check. Lucky charm, check. Seeds from Eric, check. Half-eaten piece of bread, check. I threw that piece of bread as far as I could between the trees. Now I had to turn my pocketbook upside down to get all the stupid crumbs out.

We stood in line waiting our turn to use the magic gate. I could hear it wobble as the surface of the building sized mirror warbled. It looked like the surface of a lake if something constantly disturbed it. 

“Name?” One of the magicians asked.

“Gale.”

“Last name?”

My dad went up to him and showed the token he had received from Raviel. It ensured anonymity and was only used by a select few high-ranking nobles.

“R-right this way, sir\!”

“Want to hold my hand, Esther?” Mom reached out her hand which I accepted.

“It should feel like taking a swim, no need to be worried.”

“But dad”, I said. 

“I’ve never taken a swim before.”

“Oh right.”

I felt something push me as my body fell forwards into the shimmering surface.

“See you on the other side\!” I heard my dad say.
