In a pool of her own blood, a girl bleeds to death. The only company she has with her is the buddha statue staring down at her. Was she going to go up to heaven or straight down to hell. She couldn’t help but feel the latter choice was the answer. The statue smiled smugly as she died laying beneath its feet.

She opened her eyes and saw a golden blonde beauty. Maybe she got sent to heaven by accident?
